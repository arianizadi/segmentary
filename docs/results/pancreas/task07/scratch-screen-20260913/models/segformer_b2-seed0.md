Status: **running**. Stage: **train**. GPU: **7**.

## Recipe and resources

| Setting | Value |

| Started / finished | 2026-09-14T02:21:05.099468+00:00 / — |
| Last worker update | 2026-09-14T02:21:47.162369+00:00 |
| Completed / budget steps | 0 / 10000 |
| Live step / phase | — / validation |
| Parameters | 27355203 |
| Objective | common_dice_ce |
| Checkpoint selection | maximum validation mean per-case mass Dice; empty/empty=1 |
| Selected checkpoint SHA256 | — |
| Finished-stage allocated GPU-hours | 0.0000 |
| Active-stage allocated hours (estimate) | 0.0226 |
| Peak allocated / reserved GiB | — / — |

Allocation time measures time reserved for a stage, not hardware utilization. Peaks are Torch allocator high-water marks, not total device memory. Missing official-backend timing remains unknown.

## Final validation evaluation

Not available yet. Training loss or a forward-pass smoke test cannot replace this evaluation.
