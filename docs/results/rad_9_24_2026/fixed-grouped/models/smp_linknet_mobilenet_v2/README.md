# smp_linknet_mobilenet_v2 — rad_9_24_2026-fixed-grouped

[RAD 9/24: Scene-grouped split](../../README.md) · [Full model records](record.json)

Primary result: the **final checkpoint** after the full step budget (no early stopping). The checkpoint with the best **mud-pumping validation IoU, pixels pooled over all validation images**, is kept as secondary evidence. A job is complete only after full statistics and isolated profiling are verified.

Study metrics of the final checkpoint, counting each class only on the validation images that contain it: mud-pumping IoU is the mean per-image IoU over the images with mud-pumping, precision and recall sum pixels over those images, and mIoU averages each class over the images that contain it, then over the classes present.

| Initialization path | Seed | Mud-pumping IoU, train-camera images with mud (%, n=17) | Mud-pumping IoU, all images with mud (%, n=18) | Mud precision, all images with mud (%) | Mud recall, all images with mud (%) | mIoU (each class over images that contain it) (%) |

Per-class IoU: IoU (%) of every class, each averaged only over the validation images that contain the class (n = those images); — = no image contains it. mIoU averages the classes with at least one such image.

Not available this cycle.

Everything below is the campaign's own record, with pixels pooled over all validation images: its evaluation is the checkpoint that scored best on that pooled mud IoU (secondary evidence here); the diagnostics also cover the final checkpoint (`final-auto-val`).

Training: 217 images. Validation: 37 images. Test: 60 held out. Seeds: [0]. Seed variation measures optimization variability, not independent-recording uncertainty. Historical source checkpoints stay fixed across adaptation seeds.

Training code: `fce0ea0ac50b334d4252812c396e0e593def375d`. Split SHA-256: `12d7b367c72cda61d57686ff2ac28223530d0af49debd9fb7a0fbc68b908bc93`.

## rtis_only — seed 0

Status: **training**. Started: 2026-10-11T14:57:30.793710+00:00. Finished: —.

Recipe pretrained initializer: `{"arch": "smp", "backbone_path": null, "batch_norm_momentum": null, "checkpoint": null, "classifier_path": null, "drop_path": null, "encoder_name": "mobilenet_v2", "encoder_weights": "imagenet", "head": "unified_head", "head_paths": [], "inactive_parameter_paths": [], "local_files_only": false, "lora_alpha": 32, "lora_dropout": 0.05, "lora_r": 16, "lora_targets": [], "native": null, "revision": null, "smp_arch": "Linknet", "subfolder": null, "trust_remote_code": false, "tuning": "full"}`.

`rtis_only` uses the recipe initializer, which may include pretrained segmentation components. Transfer paths load the exact historical source checkpoint below and reset the classifier; they do not reset all query/decoder features.

Source checkpoint: `Recipe pretrained initialization`.

Config SHA-256: `62625417bf36b405ab590da5dd16798cdf4aeac43599e1e37679afb9bd88207e`. Weights used for validation: `—`.

### Mud-pumping and aggregate quality

| Metric | Selected checkpoint | Final training validation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mud IoU | — | — |
| Mud precision | — | — |
| Mud recall | — | — |
| Mud Dice/F1 | — | — |
| mIoU | — | — |
| Mean accuracy | — | — |
| Mean precision | — | — |
| Mean Dice | — | — |
| Mean specificity | — | — |
| Pixel accuracy | — | — |
| Frequency-weighted IoU | — | — |
| Fixed GT-present class mIoU | — | — |
| Boundary F1 | — | — |

The selected checkpoint has independent evaluation evidence. Final values are the trainer's final validation record, not a new independent evaluation. mIoU averages classes with nonzero union, so false positives on absent classes can change its denominator. The fixed GT-class mean is supplementary and excludes absent classes; their false positives remain in the confusion matrix.

### Resource usage and timing

| Measurement | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Peak training VRAM, retained training invocation (GiB) | — |
| Peak evaluation VRAM (GiB) | — |
| Retained training invocation wall time (seconds) | — |
| Retained training invocation GPU-hours (one GPU) | — |
| Evaluation wall time (seconds) | — |
| Full evaluation pipeline images/second | — |
| Best full-state checkpoint (MiB) | — |
| Final full-state checkpoint (MiB) | — |
| Verified periodic checkpoints removed (GiB) | — |

VRAM uses the recorded allocator high-water mark; it is not total device usage including CUDA context. Resumed jobs' retained training invocation times and peaks are **not whole-campaign totals**. Earlier invocation resource records are not reconstructed here. Evaluation throughput includes loader, sliding-window inference and metrics; it is not model-only latency/FPS. Missing measurements are shown as —, never inferred from another dataset's run.

### Standardized inference performance

Dedicated model-only profiling waits for an idle worker-locked L40S: BF16, batch 1, 1024x1024, 20 warmup and 100 CUDA-event-timed public forwards. It excludes loading, preprocessing, tiling and metrics.

| Status | Parameters | Weight MiB | FPS | p50 ms | p95 ms | Peak reserved GiB |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| waiting_for_idle_gpu | — | — | — | — | — | — |

### Per-class validation results

| Class | GT pixels | IoU (%) | Precision (%) | Recall (%) | Dice (%) | Boundary F1 (%) |

| 2073 | 17.47 | 4.07 |
| 2332 | 17.73 | 4.06 |

All retained scalar curves, including training loss and per-class IoU, are in record.json. Observed best mud on a curve is not necessarily a retained checkpoint: the pilot saved its selection-metric-best and final checkpoints. Step logging and checkpoint global_step may differ by one.

### Stopping and checkpoint provenance

### Resolved training, initialization and evaluation settings

The optimizer block is the base configuration. Stage LR scales are applied at runtime, and stage warmup is capped at min(base warmup, floor(stage budget / 10), stage budget - 1): 400 steps for this 4,000-step pilot. Model-internal native input grids may differ from augmentation crops (EoMT uses its 640 grid).

Recipe pretrained initializer: `{"arch": "smp", "backbone_path": null, "batch_norm_momentum": null, "checkpoint": null, "classifier_path": null, "drop_path": null, "encoder_name": "mobilenet_v2", "encoder_weights": "imagenet", "head": "unified_head", "head_paths": [], "inactive_parameter_paths": [], "local_files_only": false, "lora_alpha": 32, "lora_dropout": 0.05, "lora_r": 16, "lora_targets": [], "native": null, "revision": null, "smp_arch": "Linknet", "subfolder": null, "trust_remote_code": false, "tuning": "full"}`.

`rtis_only` uses the recipe initializer, which may include pretrained segmentation components. Transfer paths load the exact historical source checkpoint below and reset the classifier; they do not reset all query/decoder features.

Source checkpoint: `{'name': 'smp_linknet_mobilenet_v2--railsem19--seed-0', 'model': 'smp_linknet_mobilenet_v2', 'protocol': 'railsem19', 'config': '/data/izadia1/projects/segmentary-runs/all-model-city-rail-seed0-rail20-b9eb3e1/jobs/smp_linknet_mobilenet_v2--railsem19--seed-0/attempt-001/resolved-config.yaml', 'checkpoint': '/data/izadia1/projects/segmentary-runs/all-model-city-rail-seed0-rail20-b9eb3e1/jobs/smp_linknet_mobilenet_v2--railsem19--seed-0/attempt-001/train/smp_linknet_mobilenet_v2--railsem19_seed0/railsem19/last.ckpt', 'recorded_sha256': 'fccf4aa72f1f3a7bafb70eff9caef9a6554d82613783fa2a2b339ff804e30a6f', 'exists': True}`.

Config SHA-256: `4ccd2c875bc2e444a4610f18bfaaef3728a396426c415beecb70ede5d7f478c0`. Weights used for validation: `—`.

### Mud-pumping and aggregate quality

| Metric | Selected checkpoint | Final training validation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mud IoU | — | — |
| Mud precision | — | — |
| Mud recall | — | — |
| Mud Dice/F1 | — | — |
| mIoU | — | — |
| Mean accuracy | — | — |
| Mean precision | — | — |
| Mean Dice | — | — |
| Mean specificity | — | — |
| Pixel accuracy | — | — |
| Frequency-weighted IoU | — | — |
| Fixed GT-present class mIoU | — | — |
| Boundary F1 | — | — |

The selected checkpoint has independent evaluation evidence. Final values are the trainer's final validation record, not a new independent evaluation. mIoU averages classes with nonzero union, so false positives on absent classes can change its denominator. The fixed GT-class mean is supplementary and excludes absent classes; their false positives remain in the confusion matrix.

### Resource usage and timing

| Measurement | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Peak training VRAM, retained training invocation (GiB) | — |
| Peak evaluation VRAM (GiB) | — |
| Retained training invocation wall time (seconds) | — |
| Retained training invocation GPU-hours (one GPU) | — |
| Evaluation wall time (seconds) | — |
| Full evaluation pipeline images/second | — |
| Best full-state checkpoint (MiB) | — |
| Final full-state checkpoint (MiB) | — |
| Verified periodic checkpoints removed (GiB) | — |

VRAM uses the recorded allocator high-water mark; it is not total device usage including CUDA context. Resumed jobs' retained training invocation times and peaks are **not whole-campaign totals**. Earlier invocation resource records are not reconstructed here. Evaluation throughput includes loader, sliding-window inference and metrics; it is not model-only latency/FPS. Missing measurements are shown as —, never inferred from another dataset's run.

### Standardized inference performance

Dedicated model-only profiling waits for an idle worker-locked L40S: BF16, batch 1, 1024x1024, 20 warmup and 100 CUDA-event-timed public forwards. It excludes loading, preprocessing, tiling and metrics.

| Status | Parameters | Weight MiB | FPS | p50 ms | p95 ms | Peak reserved GiB |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| waiting_for_idle_gpu | — | — | — | — | — | — |

```json
{
  "status": "waiting_for_idle_gpu",
  "contract": "L40S; batch 1; 1024x1024; BF16; 20 warmup; 100 timed forwards"

### Per-class validation results

| Class | GT pixels | IoU (%) | Precision (%) | Recall (%) | Dice (%) | Boundary F1 (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

### Validation tracking

| Logged step | Overall mIoU (%) | Mud IoU (%) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 258 | 19.54 | 0.32 |
| 518 | 20.85 | 1.78 |
| 777 | 23.82 | 6.55 |
| 1036 | 24.80 | 11.63 |
| 1295 | 22.72 | 4.73 |
| 1555 | 25.37 | 4.52 |
| 1814 | 25.13 | 5.23 |
| 2073 | 24.61 | 11.10 |

All retained scalar curves, including training loss and per-class IoU, are in record.json. Observed best mud on a curve is not necessarily a retained checkpoint: the pilot saved its selection-metric-best and final checkpoints. Step logging and checkpoint global_step may differ by one.

### Stopping and checkpoint provenance

```json
{
  "stopping": null,
  "checkpoints": null,
  "cleanup_error": null
}
```

### Resolved training, initialization and evaluation settings

The optimizer block is the base configuration. Stage LR scales are applied at runtime, and stage warmup is capped at min(base warmup, floor(stage budget / 10), stage budget - 1): 400 steps for this 4,000-step pilot. Model-internal native input grids may differ from augmentation crops (EoMT uses its 640 grid).
