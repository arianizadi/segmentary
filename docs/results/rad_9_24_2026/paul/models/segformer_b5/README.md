[RAD 9/24: Paul's split](../../README.md) · [Full model records](record.json)

Primary selection and early stopping: **mud-pumping validation IoU, pixels pooled over all validation images**. A job is complete only after full statistics and isolated profiling are verified.

Study metrics, counting each class only on the validation images that contain it: mud-pumping IoU is the mean per-image IoU over the images with mud-pumping, precision and recall sum pixels over those images, and mIoU averages each class over the images that contain it, then over the classes present.

| Initialization path | Seed | Mud-pumping IoU, train-camera images with mud (%, n=7) | Mud-pumping IoU, all images with mud (%, n=13) | Mud precision, all images with mud (%) | Mud recall, all images with mud (%) | mIoU (each class over images that contain it) (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

| cityscapes_to_railsem19_to_rtis | 0 | 60.04 | 68.40 | 96.94 | 94.37 | 54.73 |

Per-class IoU: IoU (%) of every class, each averaged only over the validation images that contain the class (n = those images); — = no image contains it. mIoU averages the classes with at least one such image.

| Initialization path | Seed | mIoU (each class over images that contain it) | person (n=12) | truck (n=5) | rail-track (n=31) | vegetation-overgrowth (n=14) | car (n=6) | on-rails (n=6) | traffic-sign (n=10) | road (n=12) | sidewalk (n=16) | construction (n=26) | tram-track (n=5) | pole (n=25) | traffic-light (n=8) | mud-pumping (n=13) | fence (n=17) | terrain (n=34) | sky (n=28) | rail-embedded (n=5) | rail-raised (n=36) | trackbed (n=32) | standing-water (n=6) |

Training: 227 images. Validation: 37 images. Test: 50 held out. Seeds: [0]. Seed variation measures optimization variability, not independent-recording uncertainty. Historical source checkpoints stay fixed across adaptation seeds.

Training code: `d864b72bd90706260965bb1a48398d01167b6d5c`. Split SHA-256: `b16dbbc7c4aa0c5d6e0fb5a20a27b4f3f8a4f3ce535621ed7c9aeaa6e85adb77`.

## rtis_only — seed 0

Status: **completed**. Started: 2026-10-05T06:13:48.004347+00:00. Finished: 2026-10-05T07:38:28.741568+00:00.

Recipe pretrained initializer: `nvidia/mit-b5`.

`rtis_only` uses the recipe initializer, which may include pretrained segmentation components. Transfer paths load the exact historical source checkpoint below and reset the classifier; they do not reset all query/decoder features.

Source checkpoint: `Recipe pretrained initialization`.

Config SHA-256: `3e4a9c0fcd13c3b9ec6a913e163af59715ac52b240f7f8b5531f2e73e9d4f21e`. Weights used for validation: `raw`.

### Mud-pumping and aggregate quality

| Metric | Selected checkpoint | Final training validation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mud IoU | 93.08 | 92.54 |
| Mud precision | 95.74 | 95.47 |
| Mud recall | 97.10 | 96.79 |
| Mud Dice/F1 | 96.42 | 96.13 |
| mIoU | 59.13 | 59.77 |
| Mean accuracy | 73.62 | 72.93 |
| Mean precision | 73.72 | 75.50 |
| Mean Dice | 71.74 | 72.25 |
| Mean specificity | 99.40 | 99.41 |
| Pixel accuracy | 88.92 | 89.17 |
| Frequency-weighted IoU | 81.59 | 81.83 |
| Fixed GT-present class mIoU | 59.13 | 59.77 |
| Boundary F1 | 68.65 | 69.43 |

The selected checkpoint has independent evaluation evidence. Final values are the trainer's final validation record, not a new independent evaluation. mIoU averages classes with nonzero union, so false positives on absent classes can change its denominator. The fixed GT-class mean is supplementary and excludes absent classes; their false positives remain in the confusion matrix.

### Resource usage and timing

| Measurement | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Peak training VRAM, retained training invocation (GiB) | 16.31 |
| Peak evaluation VRAM (GiB) | 7.78 |
| Retained training invocation wall time (seconds) | 4753.70 |
| Retained training invocation GPU-hours (one GPU) | 1.32 |
| Evaluation wall time (seconds) | 29.53 |
| Full evaluation pipeline images/second | 1.25 |
| Best full-state checkpoint (MiB) | 1292.96 |
| Final full-state checkpoint (MiB) | 1292.91 |
| Verified periodic checkpoints removed (GiB) | 7.58 |

VRAM uses the recorded allocator high-water mark; it is not total device usage including CUDA context. Resumed jobs' retained training invocation times and peaks are **not whole-campaign totals**. Earlier invocation resource records are not reconstructed here. Evaluation throughput includes loader, sliding-window inference and metrics; it is not model-only latency/FPS. Missing measurements are shown as —, never inferred from another dataset's run.

### Standardized inference performance

Dedicated model-only profiling waits for an idle worker-locked L40S: BF16, batch 1, 1024x1024, 20 warmup and 100 CUDA-event-timed public forwards. It excludes loading, preprocessing, tiling and metrics.

### Full-run accounting

| Measurement | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Full GPU-reserved wall seconds, all recorded worker attempts | 5088.33 |
| Full reserved GPU-hours | 1.41 |
| Whole-run timing complete | True |

| Phase | Wall seconds including failed attempts |
| --- | --- |
| training | 4761.61 |
| diagnostics | 252.56 |
| performance | 17.59 |

GPU-reserved time includes model loading, training, validation, collection, profiling, checkpoint I/O and orchestration while the worker owns one GPU. It is not GPU kernel-active time. Phase timings and sampled device memory/power/utilization are retained separately; sampled device memory is not the allocator high-water mark.

### Train/validation and raw/EMA diagnostics

| Checkpoint / weights / split | Images | Mud IoU (%) | Mud precision (%) | Mud recall (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| best-auto-train / raw | 227 | 96.52 | 97.79 | 98.68 |
| best-auto-val / raw | 37 | 93.08 | 95.74 | 97.10 |
| best-alternate-val / ema | 37 | 92.95 | 96.02 | 96.68 |
| final-auto-val / raw | 37 | 92.54 | 95.47 | 96.79 |

Train uses the evaluation transform without augmentation. Compare mud train/validation metrics for the same selected weights. Alternate EMA on running-stat BatchNorm is explicitly uncalibrated and is diagnostic only. Score-threshold curves use uncalibrated normalized scores and are pixel-level diagnostics, not event detection rates or a selected deployment operating point.

![Selected-checkpoint validation examples](rtis_only--seed-0/best-auto-val/examples.jpg)

Examples are two lowest and two highest mud-IoU positive images, plus up to two negative images with the most false-positive mud pixels. They are targeted diagnostic examples, not random samples. Green: true positive; red: false positive; yellow: false negative. Full predictions remain on HDRFS.

### Validation tracking

| Logged step | Overall mIoU (%) | Mud IoU (%) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 264 | 46.46 | 85.44 |
| 530 | 54.73 | 91.20 |
| 796 | 56.73 | 91.44 |
| 1061 | 58.72 | 91.21 |
| 1326 | 58.74 | 90.80 |
| 1592 | 60.06 | 91.55 |
| 1857 | 59.13 | 93.08 |
| 2123 | 60.65 | 92.14 |
| 2389 | 60.45 | 91.15 |
| 2653 | 60.20 | 91.70 |
| 2919 | 59.39 | 92.39 |
| 3185 | 59.77 | 92.54 |

All retained scalar curves, including training loss and per-class IoU, are in record.json. Observed best mud on a curve is not necessarily a retained checkpoint: the pilot saved its selection-metric-best and final checkpoints. Step logging and checkpoint global_step may differ by one.

### Resolved training, initialization and evaluation settings

The optimizer block is the base configuration. Stage LR scales are applied at runtime, and stage warmup is capped at min(base warmup, floor(stage budget / 10), stage budget - 1): 400 steps for this 4,000-step pilot. Model-internal native input grids may differ from augmentation crops (EoMT uses its 640 grid).

## cityscapes_to_rtis — seed 0

Status: **completed**. Started: 2026-10-05T06:43:31.153317+00:00. Finished: 2026-10-05T08:28:04.489408+00:00.

Recipe pretrained initializer: `nvidia/mit-b5`.

`rtis_only` uses the recipe initializer, which may include pretrained segmentation components. Transfer paths load the exact historical source checkpoint below and reset the classifier; they do not reset all query/decoder features.

Source checkpoint: `{'name': 'segformer_b5--cityscapes--seed-0', 'model': 'segformer_b5', 'protocol': 'cityscapes', 'config': '/data/izadia1/projects/segmentary-runs/all-model-city-rail-seed0-rail20-b9eb3e1/accepted/segformer_b5--cityscapes--seed-0/resolved-config.yaml', 'checkpoint': '/data/izadia1/projects/segmentary-runs/all-model-city-rail-seed0-a7c0b67/jobs/segformer_b5--cityscapes--seed-0/attempt-001/train/segformer_b5--cityscapes_seed0/cityscapes/last.ckpt', 'recorded_sha256': '303e1dd639de11fd66defadcba0eea5a2179ca0b1a8d768c1dde8f8e1f135b85', 'exists': True}`.

Config SHA-256: `55c9e1b4f5e714e07c4d481878ce5cd1f2262ee9205443d0a570f2bcfce1d4cc`. Weights used for validation: `raw`.

### Mud-pumping and aggregate quality

| Metric | Selected checkpoint | Final training validation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mud IoU | 91.35 | 89.86 |
| Mud precision | 95.44 | 93.25 |
| Mud recall | 95.51 | 96.11 |
| Mud Dice/F1 | 95.48 | 94.66 |
| mIoU | 59.12 | 59.74 |
| Mean accuracy | 72.93 | 74.14 |
| Mean precision | 72.26 | 72.07 |
| Mean Dice | 71.82 | 72.42 |
| Mean specificity | 99.38 | 99.39 |
| Pixel accuracy | 88.51 | 88.59 |
| Frequency-weighted IoU | 81.07 | 81.09 |
| Fixed GT-present class mIoU | 59.12 | 59.74 |
| Boundary F1 | 68.27 | 68.67 |

The selected checkpoint has independent evaluation evidence. Final values are the trainer's final validation record, not a new independent evaluation. mIoU averages classes with nonzero union, so false positives on absent classes can change its denominator. The fixed GT-class mean is supplementary and excludes absent classes; their false positives remain in the confusion matrix.

### Resource usage and timing

| Measurement | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Peak training VRAM, retained training invocation (GiB) | 16.31 |
| Peak evaluation VRAM (GiB) | 7.78 |
| Retained training invocation wall time (seconds) | 5944.48 |
| Retained training invocation GPU-hours (one GPU) | 1.65 |
| Evaluation wall time (seconds) | 29.36 |
| Full evaluation pipeline images/second | 1.26 |
| Best full-state checkpoint (MiB) | 1292.96 |
| Final full-state checkpoint (MiB) | 1292.91 |
| Verified periodic checkpoints removed (GiB) | 8.84 |

VRAM uses the recorded allocator high-water mark; it is not total device usage including CUDA context. Resumed jobs' retained training invocation times and peaks are **not whole-campaign totals**. Earlier invocation resource records are not reconstructed here. Evaluation throughput includes loader, sliding-window inference and metrics; it is not model-only latency/FPS. Missing measurements are shown as —, never inferred from another dataset's run.

### Standardized inference performance

Dedicated model-only profiling waits for an idle worker-locked L40S: BF16, batch 1, 1024x1024, 20 warmup and 100 CUDA-event-timed public forwards. It excludes loading, preprocessing, tiling and metrics.

| Status | Parameters | Weight MiB | FPS | p50 ms | p95 ms | Peak reserved GiB |

| complete | 84609493 | 322.76 | 27.73 | 35.97 | 36.75 | 2.57 |

### Full-run accounting

| Measurement | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Full GPU-reserved wall seconds, all recorded worker attempts | 6281.60 |
| Full reserved GPU-hours | 1.74 |
| Whole-run timing complete | True |

| Phase | Wall seconds including failed attempts |
| --- | --- |
| training | 5952.47 |
| diagnostics | 253.73 |
| performance | 17.17 |

GPU-reserved time includes model loading, training, validation, collection, profiling, checkpoint I/O and orchestration while the worker owns one GPU. It is not GPU kernel-active time. Phase timings and sampled device memory/power/utilization are retained separately; sampled device memory is not the allocator high-water mark.

### Train/validation and raw/EMA diagnostics

| Checkpoint / weights / split | Images | Mud IoU (%) | Mud precision (%) | Mud recall (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| best-auto-train / raw | 227 | 94.52 | 97.33 | 97.04 |
| best-auto-val / raw | 37 | 91.35 | 95.44 | 95.51 |
| best-alternate-val / ema | 37 | 90.35 | 93.75 | 96.14 |
| final-auto-val / raw | 37 | 89.86 | 93.24 | 96.12 |

Train uses the evaluation transform without augmentation. Compare mud train/validation metrics for the same selected weights. Alternate EMA on running-stat BatchNorm is explicitly uncalibrated and is diagnostic only. Score-threshold curves use uncalibrated normalized scores and are pixel-level diagnostics, not event detection rates or a selected deployment operating point.

![Selected-checkpoint validation examples](cityscapes_to_rtis--seed-0/best-auto-val/examples.jpg)

Examples are two lowest and two highest mud-IoU positive images, plus up to two negative images with the most false-positive mud pixels. They are targeted diagnostic examples, not random samples. Green: true positive; red: false positive; yellow: false negative. Full predictions remain on HDRFS.

### Validation tracking

| Logged step | Overall mIoU (%) | Mud IoU (%) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 264 | 35.44 | 69.25 |
| 530 | 50.17 | 83.51 |
| 796 | 57.56 | 86.49 |
| 1061 | 58.57 | 87.86 |
| 1326 | 58.55 | 87.51 |
| 1592 | 58.94 | 87.14 |
| 1857 | 58.82 | 89.92 |
| 2123 | 58.18 | 88.73 |
| 2389 | 59.46 | 90.62 |
| 2653 | 59.08 | 91.31 |
| 2919 | 59.12 | 91.34 |
| 3185 | 59.62 | 90.66 |
| 3451 | 59.92 | 90.49 |
| 3716 | 59.70 | 90.74 |
| 3981 | 59.74 | 89.86 |

All retained scalar curves, including training loss and per-class IoU, are in record.json. Observed best mud on a curve is not necessarily a retained checkpoint: the pilot saved its selection-metric-best and final checkpoints. Step logging and checkpoint global_step may differ by one.

### Resolved training, initialization and evaluation settings

The optimizer block is the base configuration. Stage LR scales are applied at runtime, and stage warmup is capped at min(base warmup, floor(stage budget / 10), stage budget - 1): 400 steps for this 4,000-step pilot. Model-internal native input grids may differ from augmentation crops (EoMT uses its 640 grid).

## railsem19_to_rtis — seed 0

Status: **completed**. Started: 2026-10-05T06:52:12.351740+00:00. Finished: 2026-10-05T08:17:24.947283+00:00.

Recipe pretrained initializer: `nvidia/mit-b5`.

`rtis_only` uses the recipe initializer, which may include pretrained segmentation components. Transfer paths load the exact historical source checkpoint below and reset the classifier; they do not reset all query/decoder features.

Source checkpoint: `{'name': 'segformer_b5--railsem19--seed-0', 'model': 'segformer_b5', 'protocol': 'railsem19', 'config': '/data/izadia1/projects/segmentary-runs/all-model-city-rail-seed0-rail20-b9eb3e1/accepted/segformer_b5--railsem19--seed-0/resolved-config.yaml', 'checkpoint': '/data/izadia1/projects/segmentary-runs/all-model-city-rail-seed0-a7c0b67/jobs/segformer_b5--railsem19--seed-0/attempt-001/train/segformer_b5--railsem19_seed0/railsem19/last.ckpt', 'recorded_sha256': '7ecee01e5337241e3e2d864a36e5ad717ac57365a8fa50747fd19ff25d7debe1', 'exists': True}`.

Config SHA-256: `1d39fabfe3eda53b9b2b499ab8d6b22a6a71eff1b5ccd1c1b4d66279f52577af`. Weights used for validation: `raw`.

### Mud-pumping and aggregate quality

| Metric | Selected checkpoint | Final training validation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mud IoU | 90.39 | 89.77 |
| Mud precision | 94.08 | 92.75 |
| Mud recall | 95.84 | 96.55 |
| Mud Dice/F1 | 94.95 | 94.61 |
| mIoU | 69.54 | 69.64 |
| Mean accuracy | 81.35 | 80.73 |
| Mean precision | 80.97 | 81.56 |
| Mean Dice | 80.83 | 80.75 |
| Mean specificity | 99.53 | 99.55 |
| Pixel accuracy | 91.32 | 91.64 |
| Frequency-weighted IoU | 84.90 | 85.32 |
| Fixed GT-present class mIoU | 69.54 | 69.64 |
| Boundary F1 | 75.13 | 75.79 |

The selected checkpoint has independent evaluation evidence. Final values are the trainer's final validation record, not a new independent evaluation. mIoU averages classes with nonzero union, so false positives on absent classes can change its denominator. The fixed GT-class mean is supplementary and excludes absent classes; their false positives remain in the confusion matrix.

### Resource usage and timing

| Measurement | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Peak training VRAM, retained training invocation (GiB) | 16.31 |
| Peak evaluation VRAM (GiB) | 7.78 |
| Retained training invocation wall time (seconds) | 4787.68 |
| Retained training invocation GPU-hours (one GPU) | 1.33 |
| Evaluation wall time (seconds) | 29.07 |
| Full evaluation pipeline images/second | 1.27 |
| Best full-state checkpoint (MiB) | 1292.96 |
| Final full-state checkpoint (MiB) | 1292.91 |
| Verified periodic checkpoints removed (GiB) | 7.58 |

VRAM uses the recorded allocator high-water mark; it is not total device usage including CUDA context. Resumed jobs' retained training invocation times and peaks are **not whole-campaign totals**. Earlier invocation resource records are not reconstructed here. Evaluation throughput includes loader, sliding-window inference and metrics; it is not model-only latency/FPS. Missing measurements are shown as —, never inferred from another dataset's run.

### Standardized inference performance

Dedicated model-only profiling waits for an idle worker-locked L40S: BF16, batch 1, 1024x1024, 20 warmup and 100 CUDA-event-timed public forwards. It excludes loading, preprocessing, tiling and metrics.

| Status | Parameters | Weight MiB | FPS | p50 ms | p95 ms | Peak reserved GiB |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| complete | 84609493 | 322.76 | 27.47 | 36.03 | 37.58 | 2.57 |

### Full-run accounting

| Measurement | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Full GPU-reserved wall seconds, all recorded worker attempts | 5120.91 |
| Full reserved GPU-hours | 1.42 |
| Whole-run timing complete | True |

| Phase | Wall seconds including failed attempts |
| --- | --- |
| training | 4795.67 |
| diagnostics | 251.62 |
| performance | 17.12 |

GPU-reserved time includes model loading, training, validation, collection, profiling, checkpoint I/O and orchestration while the worker owns one GPU. It is not GPU kernel-active time. Phase timings and sampled device memory/power/utilization are retained separately; sampled device memory is not the allocator high-water mark.

### Train/validation and raw/EMA diagnostics

| Checkpoint / weights / split | Images | Mud IoU (%) | Mud precision (%) | Mud recall (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| best-auto-train / raw | 227 | 93.54 | 96.58 | 96.74 |
| best-auto-val / raw | 37 | 90.39 | 94.08 | 95.84 |
| best-alternate-val / ema | 37 | 90.52 | 93.91 | 96.17 |
| final-auto-val / raw | 37 | 89.78 | 92.75 | 96.56 |

Train uses the evaluation transform without augmentation. Compare mud train/validation metrics for the same selected weights. Alternate EMA on running-stat BatchNorm is explicitly uncalibrated and is diagnostic only. Score-threshold curves use uncalibrated normalized scores and are pixel-level diagnostics, not event detection rates or a selected deployment operating point.

![Selected-checkpoint validation examples](railsem19_to_rtis--seed-0/best-auto-val/examples.jpg)

Examples are two lowest and two highest mud-IoU positive images, plus up to two negative images with the most false-positive mud pixels. They are targeted diagnostic examples, not random samples. Green: true positive; red: false positive; yellow: false negative. Full predictions remain on HDRFS.

### Validation tracking

| Logged step | Overall mIoU (%) | Mud IoU (%) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 264 | 44.51 | 73.25 |
| 530 | 63.90 | 86.64 |
| 796 | 66.31 | 88.59 |
| 1061 | 67.35 | 89.58 |
| 1326 | 68.72 | 90.21 |
| 1592 | 68.88 | 89.20 |
| 1857 | 69.55 | 90.39 |
| 2123 | 69.09 | 89.27 |
| 2389 | 69.81 | 90.37 |
| 2653 | 69.31 | 90.18 |
| 2919 | 69.86 | 89.68 |
| 3185 | 69.64 | 89.77 |

All retained scalar curves, including training loss and per-class IoU, are in record.json. Observed best mud on a curve is not necessarily a retained checkpoint: the pilot saved its selection-metric-best and final checkpoints. Step logging and checkpoint global_step may differ by one.

### Resolved training, initialization and evaluation settings

The optimizer block is the base configuration. Stage LR scales are applied at runtime, and stage warmup is capped at min(base warmup, floor(stage budget / 10), stage budget - 1): 400 steps for this 4,000-step pilot. Model-internal native input grids may differ from augmentation crops (EoMT uses its 640 grid).

## cityscapes_to_railsem19_to_rtis — seed 0

Status: **completed**. Started: 2026-10-05T06:59:27.890961+00:00. Finished: 2026-10-05T08:44:43.486364+00:00.

Recipe pretrained initializer: `nvidia/mit-b5`.

`rtis_only` uses the recipe initializer, which may include pretrained segmentation components. Transfer paths load the exact historical source checkpoint below and reset the classifier; they do not reset all query/decoder features.

Source checkpoint: `{'name': 'segformer_b5--cityscapes_to_railsem19--seed-0', 'model': 'segformer_b5', 'protocol': 'cityscapes_to_railsem19', 'config': '/data/izadia1/projects/segmentary-runs/all-model-city-rail-seed0-rail20-b9eb3e1/jobs/segformer_b5--cityscapes_to_railsem19--seed-0/attempt-001/resolved-config.yaml', 'checkpoint': '/data/izadia1/projects/segmentary-runs/all-model-city-rail-seed0-rail20-b9eb3e1/jobs/segformer_b5--cityscapes_to_railsem19--seed-0/attempt-001/train/segformer_b5--cityscapes_to_railsem19_seed0/railsem19/last.ckpt', 'recorded_sha256': '1a5f4c144fb89fea0250bbd390739f7e210be0bbb899acc2b64b6c0b2885051b', 'exists': True}`.

Config SHA-256: `1c28bbdb33b84eef8a8cd1cafb131eec7f70851c326c167ce7efdd0dc90bf80d`. Weights used for validation: `raw`.

### Mud-pumping and aggregate quality

| Metric | Selected checkpoint | Final training validation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mud IoU | 91.25 | 89.81 |
| Mud precision | 96.50 | 95.92 |
| Mud recall | 94.37 | 93.38 |
| Mud Dice/F1 | 95.42 | 94.63 |
| mIoU | 65.09 | 65.74 |
| Mean accuracy | 78.73 | 79.97 |
| Mean precision | 77.10 | 77.03 |
| Mean Dice | 77.38 | 78.04 |
| Mean specificity | 99.51 | 99.51 |
| Pixel accuracy | 90.91 | 90.81 |
| Frequency-weighted IoU | 84.32 | 84.19 |
| Fixed GT-present class mIoU | 65.09 | 65.74 |
| Boundary F1 | 71.43 | 72.81 |

The selected checkpoint has independent evaluation evidence. Final values are the trainer's final validation record, not a new independent evaluation. mIoU averages classes with nonzero union, so false positives on absent classes can change its denominator. The fixed GT-class mean is supplementary and excludes absent classes; their false positives remain in the confusion matrix.

### Resource usage and timing

| Measurement | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Peak training VRAM, retained training invocation (GiB) | 16.31 |
| Peak evaluation VRAM (GiB) | 7.78 |
| Retained training invocation wall time (seconds) | 5986.46 |
| Retained training invocation GPU-hours (one GPU) | 1.66 |
| Evaluation wall time (seconds) | 29.19 |
| Full evaluation pipeline images/second | 1.27 |
| Best full-state checkpoint (MiB) | 1292.96 |
| Final full-state checkpoint (MiB) | 1292.91 |
| Verified periodic checkpoints removed (GiB) | 10.10 |

VRAM uses the recorded allocator high-water mark; it is not total device usage including CUDA context. Resumed jobs' retained training invocation times and peaks are **not whole-campaign totals**. Earlier invocation resource records are not reconstructed here. Evaluation throughput includes loader, sliding-window inference and metrics; it is not model-only latency/FPS. Missing measurements are shown as —, never inferred from another dataset's run.

### Standardized inference performance

Dedicated model-only profiling waits for an idle worker-locked L40S: BF16, batch 1, 1024x1024, 20 warmup and 100 CUDA-event-timed public forwards. It excludes loading, preprocessing, tiling and metrics.

| Status | Parameters | Weight MiB | FPS | p50 ms | p95 ms | Peak reserved GiB |

### Full-run accounting

| Measurement | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Full GPU-reserved wall seconds, all recorded worker attempts | 6324.00 |
| Full reserved GPU-hours | 1.76 |
| Whole-run timing complete | True |

| Phase | Wall seconds including failed attempts |
| --- | --- |
| training | 5994.28 |
| diagnostics | 253.43 |
| performance | 17.40 |

GPU-reserved time includes model loading, training, validation, collection, profiling, checkpoint I/O and orchestration while the worker owns one GPU. It is not GPU kernel-active time. Phase timings and sampled device memory/power/utilization are retained separately; sampled device memory is not the allocator high-water mark.

### Train/validation and raw/EMA diagnostics

| Checkpoint / weights / split | Images | Mud IoU (%) | Mud precision (%) | Mud recall (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| best-auto-train / raw | 227 | 94.46 | 97.35 | 96.95 |
| best-auto-val / raw | 37 | 91.25 | 96.50 | 94.37 |
| best-alternate-val / ema | 37 | 89.36 | 96.57 | 92.29 |
| final-auto-val / raw | 37 | 89.80 | 95.91 | 93.37 |

Train uses the evaluation transform without augmentation. Compare mud train/validation metrics for the same selected weights. Alternate EMA on running-stat BatchNorm is explicitly uncalibrated and is diagnostic only. Score-threshold curves use uncalibrated normalized scores and are pixel-level diagnostics, not event detection rates or a selected deployment operating point.

Examples are two lowest and two highest mud-IoU positive images, plus up to two negative images with the most false-positive mud pixels. They are targeted diagnostic examples, not random samples. Green: true positive; red: false positive; yellow: false negative. Full predictions remain on HDRFS.

### Validation tracking

| Logged step | Overall mIoU (%) | Mud IoU (%) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 264 | 42.79 | 66.26 |
| 530 | 58.22 | 75.64 |
| 796 | 63.56 | 80.04 |
| 1061 | 65.16 | 88.86 |
| 1326 | 64.05 | 85.99 |
| 1592 | 64.51 | 89.41 |
| 1857 | 64.59 | 86.33 |
| 2123 | 64.00 | 90.12 |
| 2389 | 65.42 | 88.57 |
| 2653 | 65.04 | 89.02 |
| 2919 | 65.10 | 91.26 |

| 3981 | 65.69 | 89.27 |
| 4000 | 65.74 | 89.81 |

All retained scalar curves, including training loss and per-class IoU, are in record.json. Observed best mud on a curve is not necessarily a retained checkpoint: the pilot saved its selection-metric-best and final checkpoints. Step logging and checkpoint global_step may differ by one.

### Resolved training, initialization and evaluation settings

The optimizer block is the base configuration. Stage LR scales are applied at runtime, and stage warmup is capped at min(base warmup, floor(stage budget / 10), stage budget - 1): 400 steps for this 4,000-step pilot. Model-internal native input grids may differ from augmentation crops (EoMT uses its 640 grid).
