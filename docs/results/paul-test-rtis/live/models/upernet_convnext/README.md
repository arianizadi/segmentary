Training: 220 images. Validation: 37 images. Test: 50 held out. Seeds: [0, 1, 2]. Seed variation measures optimization variability, not independent-recording uncertainty. Historical source checkpoints stay fixed across adaptation seeds.

Training code: `066afb2626398b7be59d4d19f5a0e4644fd59adc`. Split SHA-256: `71fef8292610c352da0709fe3bd030f3bcc18f97560394835f4b22826463b83d`.

## rtis_only — seed 0

Status: **collecting**. Started: 2026-09-07T12:06:51.751101+00:00. Finished: —.

Recipe pretrained initializer: `openmmlab/upernet-convnext-small`.

`rtis_only` uses the recipe initializer, which may include pretrained segmentation components. Transfer paths load the exact historical source checkpoint below and reset the classifier; they do not reset all query/decoder features.

Source checkpoint: `Recipe pretrained initialization`.

Config SHA-256: `b8be43b36048f6fb7673602ac1cba48bea838e2fed02e4c76eb95f3ba785156c`. Weights used for validation: `raw`.

### Mud-pumping and aggregate quality

| Metric | Selected checkpoint | Final training validation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mud IoU | 9.36 | 2.60 |
| Mud precision | 17.88 | 4.08 |
| Mud recall | 16.43 | 6.68 |
| Mud Dice/F1 | 17.13 | 5.07 |
| mIoU | 35.24 | 34.49 |
| Mean accuracy | 47.78 | 48.69 |
| Mean precision | 57.79 | 56.36 |
| Mean Dice | 45.28 | 44.50 |
| Mean specificity | 98.95 | 98.78 |
| Pixel accuracy | 83.68 | 82.04 |
| Frequency-weighted IoU | 73.90 | 71.25 |
| Fixed GT-present class mIoU | 39.15 | 40.24 |
| Boundary F1 | 43.18 | 40.09 |

The selected checkpoint has independent evaluation evidence. Final values are the trainer's final validation record, not a new independent evaluation. mIoU averages classes with nonzero union, so false positives on absent classes can change its denominator. The fixed GT-class mean is supplementary and excludes absent classes; their false positives remain in the confusion matrix.

### Resource usage and timing

| Measurement | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Peak training VRAM, retained training invocation (GiB) | 13.46 |
| Peak evaluation VRAM (GiB) | 7.68 |
| Retained training invocation wall time (seconds) | 3580.41 |
| Retained training invocation GPU-hours (one GPU) | 0.99 |
| Evaluation wall time (seconds) | 21.89 |
| Full evaluation pipeline images/second | 1.69 |
| Best full-state checkpoint (MiB) | 1234.99 |
| Final full-state checkpoint (MiB) | 1234.97 |
| Audited periodic checkpoints removed (GiB) | — |

VRAM uses the recorded allocator high-water mark; it is not total device usage including CUDA context. Resumed jobs' retained training invocation times and peaks are **not whole-campaign totals**. Earlier invocation resource records are not reconstructed here. Evaluation throughput includes loader, sliding-window inference and metrics; it is not model-only latency/FPS. Missing measurements are shown as —, never inferred from another dataset's run.

### Standardized inference performance

Dedicated model-only profiling waits for an idle worker-locked L40S: BF16, batch 1, 1024x1024, 20 warmup and 100 CUDA-event-timed public forwards. It excludes loading, preprocessing, tiling and metrics.

| Status | Parameters | Weight MiB | FPS | p50 ms | p95 ms | Peak reserved GiB |

All retained scalar curves, including training loss and per-class IoU, are in record.json. Observed best mud on a curve is not necessarily a retained checkpoint: the pilot saved its selection-metric-best and final checkpoints. Step logging and checkpoint global_step may differ by one.

### Resolved training, initialization and evaluation settings

The optimizer block is the base configuration. Stage LR scales are applied at runtime, and stage warmup is capped at min(base warmup, floor(stage budget / 10), stage budget - 1): 400 steps for this 4,000-step pilot. Model-internal native input grids may differ from augmentation crops (EoMT uses its 640 grid).

### Mud-pumping and aggregate quality

| Metric | Selected checkpoint | Final training validation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mud IoU | 4.64 | 0.50 |
| Mud precision | 5.80 | 0.59 |
| Mud recall | 18.86 | 3.23 |
| Mud Dice/F1 | 8.88 | 1.00 |
| mIoU | 32.26 | 33.64 |
| Mean accuracy | 46.67 | 46.92 |
| Mean precision | 54.65 | 58.29 |
| Mean Dice | 41.57 | 43.17 |
| Mean specificity | 98.75 | 98.80 |
| Pixel accuracy | 81.03 | 80.23 |
| Frequency-weighted IoU | 71.02 | 72.57 |
| Fixed GT-present class mIoU | 37.64 | 39.24 |
| Boundary F1 | 39.93 | 41.57 |

The selected checkpoint has independent evaluation evidence. Final values are the trainer's final validation record, not a new independent evaluation. mIoU averages classes with nonzero union, so false positives on absent classes can change its denominator. The fixed GT-class mean is supplementary and excludes absent classes; their false positives remain in the confusion matrix.

## rtis_only — seed 2

Status: **training**. Started: 2026-09-07T12:15:22.608898+00:00. Finished: —.

Recipe pretrained initializer: `openmmlab/upernet-convnext-small`.

`rtis_only` uses the recipe initializer, which may include pretrained segmentation components. Transfer paths load the exact historical source checkpoint below and reset the classifier; they do not reset all query/decoder features.

Source checkpoint: `Recipe pretrained initialization`.

Config SHA-256: `f97218319176f44a85363796e5e1612781caaed492277bfa15aea0d9211b046f`. Weights used for validation: `—`.

### Mud-pumping and aggregate quality

| Metric | Selected checkpoint | Final training validation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mud IoU | — | — |
| Mud precision | — | — |
| Mud recall | — | — |
| Mud Dice/F1 | — | — |
| mIoU | — | — |
| Mean accuracy | — | — |
| Mean precision | — | — |
| Mean Dice | — | — |
| Mean specificity | — | — |
| Pixel accuracy | — | — |
| Frequency-weighted IoU | — | — |
| Fixed GT-present class mIoU | — | — |
| Boundary F1 | — | — |

The selected checkpoint has independent evaluation evidence. Final values are the trainer's final validation record, not a new independent evaluation. mIoU averages classes with nonzero union, so false positives on absent classes can change its denominator. The fixed GT-class mean is supplementary and excludes absent classes; their false positives remain in the confusion matrix.

### Resource usage and timing

| Measurement | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Peak training VRAM, retained training invocation (GiB) | — |
| Peak evaluation VRAM (GiB) | — |
| Retained training invocation wall time (seconds) | — |
| Retained training invocation GPU-hours (one GPU) | — |
| Evaluation wall time (seconds) | — |
| Full evaluation pipeline images/second | — |
| Best full-state checkpoint (MiB) | — |
| Final full-state checkpoint (MiB) | — |
| Audited periodic checkpoints removed (GiB) | — |

VRAM uses the recorded allocator high-water mark; it is not total device usage including CUDA context. Resumed jobs' retained training invocation times and peaks are **not whole-campaign totals**. Earlier invocation resource records are not reconstructed here. Evaluation throughput includes loader, sliding-window inference and metrics; it is not model-only latency/FPS. Missing measurements are shown as —, never inferred from another dataset's run.

## cityscapes_to_rtis — seed 0

Status: **completed**. Started: 2026-09-07T12:21:24.156410+00:00. Finished: 2026-09-07T13:01:37.615533+00:00.

Recipe pretrained initializer: `openmmlab/upernet-convnext-small`.

`rtis_only` uses the recipe initializer, which may include pretrained segmentation components. Transfer paths load the exact historical source checkpoint below and reset the classifier; they do not reset all query/decoder features.

Source checkpoint: `{'name': 'upernet_convnext--cityscapes--seed-0', 'model': 'upernet_convnext', 'protocol': 'cityscapes', 'config': '/data/izadia1/projects/segmentary-runs/all-model-city-rail-seed0-rail20-b9eb3e1/accepted/upernet_convnext--cityscapes--seed-0/resolved-config.yaml', 'checkpoint': '/data/izadia1/projects/segmentary-runs/all-model-city-rail-seed0-a7c0b67/jobs/upernet_convnext--cityscapes--seed-0/attempt-001/train/upernet_convnext--cityscapes_seed0/cityscapes/last.ckpt', 'recorded_sha256': 'fb45ace4437433d1713d6afef5ee260284b053b7301e6be003f89249012dc698', 'exists': True}`.

Config SHA-256: `14a084047fe7696587cca284902948b0fe5eade0768ac19c3135164806e62c81`. Weights used for validation: `raw`.

### Mud-pumping and aggregate quality

| Metric | Selected checkpoint | Final training validation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mud IoU | 6.69 | 4.15 |
| Mud precision | 10.96 | 6.49 |
| Mud recall | 14.65 | 10.34 |
| Mud Dice/F1 | 12.54 | 7.97 |
| mIoU | 25.93 | 31.63 |
| Mean accuracy | 35.69 | 44.80 |
| Mean precision | 38.72 | 53.96 |
| Mean Dice | 32.54 | 40.64 |
| Mean specificity | 98.67 | 98.60 |
| Pixel accuracy | 80.50 | 79.46 |
| Frequency-weighted IoU | 69.06 | 68.47 |
| Fixed GT-present class mIoU | 27.37 | 36.90 |
| Boundary F1 | 29.58 | 38.15 |

The selected checkpoint has independent evaluation evidence. Final values are the trainer's final validation record, not a new independent evaluation. mIoU averages classes with nonzero union, so false positives on absent classes can change its denominator. The fixed GT-class mean is supplementary and excludes absent classes; their false positives remain in the confusion matrix.

### Resource usage and timing

| Measurement | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Peak training VRAM, retained training invocation (GiB) | 13.46 |
| Peak evaluation VRAM (GiB) | 7.68 |
| Retained training invocation wall time (seconds) | 2173.01 |
| Retained training invocation GPU-hours (one GPU) | 0.60 |
| Evaluation wall time (seconds) | 22.14 |
| Full evaluation pipeline images/second | 1.67 |
| Best full-state checkpoint (MiB) | 1234.99 |
| Final full-state checkpoint (MiB) | 1234.97 |
| Audited periodic checkpoints removed (GiB) | 3.62 |

VRAM uses the recorded allocator high-water mark; it is not total device usage including CUDA context. Resumed jobs' retained training invocation times and peaks are **not whole-campaign totals**. Earlier invocation resource records are not reconstructed here. Evaluation throughput includes loader, sliding-window inference and metrics; it is not model-only latency/FPS. Missing measurements are shown as —, never inferred from another dataset's run.

### Standardized inference performance

Dedicated model-only profiling waits for an idle worker-locked L40S: BF16, batch 1, 1024x1024, 20 warmup and 100 CUDA-event-timed public forwards. It excludes loading, preprocessing, tiling and metrics.

### Full-run accounting

| Measurement | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Full GPU-reserved wall seconds, all recorded worker attempts | 2414.58 |
| Full reserved GPU-hours | 0.67 |
| Whole-run timing complete | True |

| Phase | Wall seconds including failed attempts |
| --- | --- |
| training | 2181.04 |
| diagnostics | 174.56 |
| performance | 19.42 |

GPU-reserved time includes model loading, training, validation, collection, profiling, checkpoint I/O and orchestration while the worker owns one GPU. It is not GPU kernel-active time. Phase timings and sampled device memory/power/utilization are retained separately; sampled device memory is not the allocator high-water mark.

### Train/validation and raw/EMA diagnostics

| Checkpoint / weights / split | Images | Mud IoU (%) | Mud precision (%) | Mud recall (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| best-auto-train / raw | 220 | 86.63 | 92.38 | 93.30 |
| best-auto-val / raw | 37 | 6.69 | 10.96 | 14.65 |
| best-alternate-val / ema | 37 | 4.50 | 6.35 | 13.36 |
| final-auto-val / raw | 37 | 4.15 | 6.49 | 10.34 |

Train uses the evaluation transform without augmentation. Compare mud train/validation metrics for the same selected weights. Alternate EMA on running-stat BatchNorm is explicitly uncalibrated and is diagnostic only. Score-threshold curves use uncalibrated normalized scores and are pixel-level diagnostics, not event detection rates or a selected deployment operating point.

![Selected-checkpoint validation examples](cityscapes_to_rtis--seed-0/best-auto-val/examples.jpg)

Examples are two lowest and two highest mud-IoU positive images, plus up to two negative images with the most false-positive mud pixels. They are targeted diagnostic examples, not random samples. Green: true positive; red: false positive; yellow: false negative. Full predictions remain on HDRFS.

### Validation tracking

| Logged step | Overall mIoU (%) | Mud IoU (%) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 254 | 25.92 | 6.69 |
| 508 | 25.33 | 6.60 |
| 763 | 30.76 | 4.81 |
| 1017 | 31.39 | 2.45 |
| 1272 | 32.32 | 2.16 |
| 1527 | 31.63 | 4.15 |

All retained scalar curves, including training loss and per-class IoU, are in record.json. Observed best mud on a curve is not necessarily a retained checkpoint: the pilot saved its selection-metric-best and final checkpoints. Step logging and checkpoint global_step may differ by one.

### Resolved training, initialization and evaluation settings

The optimizer block is the base configuration. Stage LR scales are applied at runtime, and stage warmup is capped at min(base warmup, floor(stage budget / 10), stage budget - 1): 400 steps for this 4,000-step pilot. Model-internal native input grids may differ from augmentation crops (EoMT uses its 640 grid).

## cityscapes_to_rtis — seed 1

Status: **training**. Started: 2026-09-07T12:27:27.808321+00:00. Finished: —.

Recipe pretrained initializer: `openmmlab/upernet-convnext-small`.

`rtis_only` uses the recipe initializer, which may include pretrained segmentation components. Transfer paths load the exact historical source checkpoint below and reset the classifier; they do not reset all query/decoder features.

Source checkpoint: `{'name': 'upernet_convnext--cityscapes--seed-0', 'model': 'upernet_convnext', 'protocol': 'cityscapes', 'config': '/data/izadia1/projects/segmentary-runs/all-model-city-rail-seed0-rail20-b9eb3e1/accepted/upernet_convnext--cityscapes--seed-0/resolved-config.yaml', 'checkpoint': '/data/izadia1/projects/segmentary-runs/all-model-city-rail-seed0-a7c0b67/jobs/upernet_convnext--cityscapes--seed-0/attempt-001/train/upernet_convnext--cityscapes_seed0/cityscapes/last.ckpt', 'recorded_sha256': 'fb45ace4437433d1713d6afef5ee260284b053b7301e6be003f89249012dc698', 'exists': True}`.

Config SHA-256: `7095e79beb7f959c6d35e71851f4b65a27f0855af6c48dcee62f69256e8c4931`. Weights used for validation: `—`.

### Mud-pumping and aggregate quality

| Metric | Selected checkpoint | Final training validation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mud IoU | — | — |
| Mud precision | — | — |
| Mud recall | — | — |
| Mud Dice/F1 | — | — |
| mIoU | — | — |
| Mean accuracy | — | — |
| Mean precision | — | — |
| Mean Dice | — | — |
| Mean specificity | — | — |
| Pixel accuracy | — | — |
| Frequency-weighted IoU | — | — |
| Fixed GT-present class mIoU | — | — |
| Boundary F1 | — | — |

The selected checkpoint has independent evaluation evidence. Final values are the trainer's final validation record, not a new independent evaluation. mIoU averages classes with nonzero union, so false positives on absent classes can change its denominator. The fixed GT-class mean is supplementary and excludes absent classes; their false positives remain in the confusion matrix.

### Resource usage and timing

| Measurement | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Peak training VRAM, retained training invocation (GiB) | — |
| Peak evaluation VRAM (GiB) | — |
| Retained training invocation wall time (seconds) | — |
| Retained training invocation GPU-hours (one GPU) | — |
| Evaluation wall time (seconds) | — |
| Full evaluation pipeline images/second | — |
| Best full-state checkpoint (MiB) | — |
| Final full-state checkpoint (MiB) | — |
| Audited periodic checkpoints removed (GiB) | — |

VRAM uses the recorded allocator high-water mark; it is not total device usage including CUDA context. Resumed jobs' retained training invocation times and peaks are **not whole-campaign totals**. Earlier invocation resource records are not reconstructed here. Evaluation throughput includes loader, sliding-window inference and metrics; it is not model-only latency/FPS. Missing measurements are shown as —, never inferred from another dataset's run.

### Standardized inference performance

Dedicated model-only profiling waits for an idle worker-locked L40S: BF16, batch 1, 1024x1024, 20 warmup and 100 CUDA-event-timed public forwards. It excludes loading, preprocessing, tiling and metrics.

| Status | Parameters | Weight MiB | FPS | p50 ms | p95 ms | Peak reserved GiB |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| waiting_for_idle_gpu | — | — | — | — | — | — |

```json
{
  "status": "waiting_for_idle_gpu",
  "contract": "L40S; batch 1; 1024x1024; BF16; 20 warmup; 100 timed forwards"
}
```

### Per-class validation results

| Class | GT pixels | IoU (%) | Precision (%) | Recall (%) | Dice (%) | Boundary F1 (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

### Validation tracking

| Logged step | Overall mIoU (%) | Mud IoU (%) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 254 | 24.56 | 0.06 |
| 508 | 26.97 | 4.90 |
| 763 | 31.04 | 0.26 |
| 1017 | 31.53 | 1.20 |
| 1272 | 31.31 | 0.28 |
| 1527 | 29.85 | 1.74 |

All retained scalar curves, including training loss and per-class IoU, are in record.json. Observed best mud on a curve is not necessarily a retained checkpoint: the pilot saved its selection-metric-best and final checkpoints. Step logging and checkpoint global_step may differ by one.

## cityscapes_to_rtis — seed 2

Status: **completed**. Started: 2026-09-07T12:27:55.773159+00:00. Finished: 2026-09-07T13:08:08.265277+00:00.

Recipe pretrained initializer: `openmmlab/upernet-convnext-small`.

`rtis_only` uses the recipe initializer, which may include pretrained segmentation components. Transfer paths load the exact historical source checkpoint below and reset the classifier; they do not reset all query/decoder features.

Source checkpoint: `{'name': 'upernet_convnext--cityscapes--seed-0', 'model': 'upernet_convnext', 'protocol': 'cityscapes', 'config': '/data/izadia1/projects/segmentary-runs/all-model-city-rail-seed0-rail20-b9eb3e1/accepted/upernet_convnext--cityscapes--seed-0/resolved-config.yaml', 'checkpoint': '/data/izadia1/projects/segmentary-runs/all-model-city-rail-seed0-a7c0b67/jobs/upernet_convnext--cityscapes--seed-0/attempt-001/train/upernet_convnext--cityscapes_seed0/cityscapes/last.ckpt', 'recorded_sha256': 'fb45ace4437433d1713d6afef5ee260284b053b7301e6be003f89249012dc698', 'exists': True}`.

Config SHA-256: `9a1b2e09466b9130121ac6c7b987aa216690ad574750bf30cf9690ec6cbc6e85`. Weights used for validation: `raw`.

### Mud-pumping and aggregate quality

| Metric | Selected checkpoint | Final training validation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mud IoU | 5.91 | 1.00 |
| Mud precision | 10.74 | 1.32 |
| Mud recall | 11.63 | 3.93 |
| Mud Dice/F1 | 11.17 | 1.98 |
| mIoU | 24.81 | 34.04 |
| Mean accuracy | 35.44 | 45.19 |
| Mean precision | 39.78 | 59.30 |
| Mean Dice | 31.25 | 42.86 |
| Mean specificity | 98.61 | 98.80 |
| Pixel accuracy | 78.02 | 81.47 |
| Frequency-weighted IoU | 66.98 | 71.59 |
| Fixed GT-present class mIoU | 26.19 | 37.82 |
| Boundary F1 | 29.53 | 39.84 |

The selected checkpoint has independent evaluation evidence. Final values are the trainer's final validation record, not a new independent evaluation. mIoU averages classes with nonzero union, so false positives on absent classes can change its denominator. The fixed GT-class mean is supplementary and excludes absent classes; their false positives remain in the confusion matrix.

### Resource usage and timing

| Measurement | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Peak training VRAM, retained training invocation (GiB) | 13.46 |
| Peak evaluation VRAM (GiB) | 7.68 |
| Retained training invocation wall time (seconds) | 2168.18 |
| Retained training invocation GPU-hours (one GPU) | 0.60 |
| Evaluation wall time (seconds) | 22.37 |
| Full evaluation pipeline images/second | 1.65 |
| Best full-state checkpoint (MiB) | 1234.99 |
| Final full-state checkpoint (MiB) | 1234.97 |
| Audited periodic checkpoints removed (GiB) | 3.62 |

VRAM uses the recorded allocator high-water mark; it is not total device usage including CUDA context. Resumed jobs' retained training invocation times and peaks are **not whole-campaign totals**. Earlier invocation resource records are not reconstructed here. Evaluation throughput includes loader, sliding-window inference and metrics; it is not model-only latency/FPS. Missing measurements are shown as —, never inferred from another dataset's run.

### Standardized inference performance

Dedicated model-only profiling waits for an idle worker-locked L40S: BF16, batch 1, 1024x1024, 20 warmup and 100 CUDA-event-timed public forwards. It excludes loading, preprocessing, tiling and metrics.

### Full-run accounting

| Measurement | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Full GPU-reserved wall seconds, all recorded worker attempts | 2413.46 |
| Full reserved GPU-hours | 0.67 |
| Whole-run timing complete | True |

| Phase | Wall seconds including failed attempts |
| --- | --- |
| training | 2175.92 |
| diagnostics | 179.00 |
| performance | 19.11 |

GPU-reserved time includes model loading, training, validation, collection, profiling, checkpoint I/O and orchestration while the worker owns one GPU. It is not GPU kernel-active time. Phase timings and sampled device memory/power/utilization are retained separately; sampled device memory is not the allocator high-water mark.

### Train/validation and raw/EMA diagnostics

| Checkpoint / weights / split | Images | Mud IoU (%) | Mud precision (%) | Mud recall (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| best-auto-train / raw | 220 | 87.14 | 94.96 | 91.37 |
| best-auto-val / raw | 37 | 5.91 | 10.74 | 11.63 |
| best-alternate-val / ema | 37 | 9.33 | 12.51 | 26.84 |
| final-auto-val / raw | 37 | 1.00 | 1.32 | 3.93 |

Train uses the evaluation transform without augmentation. Compare mud train/validation metrics for the same selected weights. Alternate EMA on running-stat BatchNorm is explicitly uncalibrated and is diagnostic only. Score-threshold curves use uncalibrated normalized scores and are pixel-level diagnostics, not event detection rates or a selected deployment operating point.

![Selected-checkpoint validation examples](cityscapes_to_rtis--seed-2/best-auto-val/examples.jpg)

Examples are two lowest and two highest mud-IoU positive images, plus up to two negative images with the most false-positive mud pixels. They are targeted diagnostic examples, not random samples. Green: true positive; red: false positive; yellow: false negative. Full predictions remain on HDRFS.

### Validation tracking

| Logged step | Overall mIoU (%) | Mud IoU (%) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 254 | 24.81 | 5.92 |
| 508 | 27.10 | 3.35 |
| 763 | 30.94 | 4.38 |
| 1017 | 31.62 | 3.34 |
| 1272 | 34.35 | 0.83 |
| 1527 | 34.04 | 1.00 |

All retained scalar curves, including training loss and per-class IoU, are in record.json. Observed best mud on a curve is not necessarily a retained checkpoint: the pilot saved its selection-metric-best and final checkpoints. Step logging and checkpoint global_step may differ by one.

### Resolved training, initialization and evaluation settings

The optimizer block is the base configuration. Stage LR scales are applied at runtime, and stage warmup is capped at min(base warmup, floor(stage budget / 10), stage budget - 1): 400 steps for this 4,000-step pilot. Model-internal native input grids may differ from augmentation crops (EoMT uses its 640 grid).

## railsem19_to_rtis — seed 0

Status: **training**. Started: 2026-09-07T12:31:09.129353+00:00. Finished: —.

Recipe pretrained initializer: `openmmlab/upernet-convnext-small`.

`rtis_only` uses the recipe initializer, which may include pretrained segmentation components. Transfer paths load the exact historical source checkpoint below and reset the classifier; they do not reset all query/decoder features.

Source checkpoint: `{'name': 'upernet_convnext--railsem19--seed-0', 'model': 'upernet_convnext', 'protocol': 'railsem19', 'config': '/data/izadia1/projects/segmentary-runs/all-model-city-rail-seed0-rail20-b9eb3e1/accepted/upernet_convnext--railsem19--seed-0/resolved-config.yaml', 'checkpoint': '/data/izadia1/projects/segmentary-runs/all-model-city-rail-seed0-a7c0b67/jobs/upernet_convnext--railsem19--seed-0/attempt-001/train/upernet_convnext--railsem19_seed0/railsem19/last.ckpt', 'recorded_sha256': '6e246e8e61f02c4359f944d776168359392cec5c1c750d4ba29c6637f80b9f3a', 'exists': True}`.

Config SHA-256: `e5d7742977aa9701a6a3b448555589617cb09f9b91021ba3fd1d087756df9b4a`. Weights used for validation: `—`.

### Mud-pumping and aggregate quality

| Metric | Selected checkpoint | Final training validation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mud IoU | — | — |
| Mud precision | — | — |
| Mud recall | — | — |
| Mud Dice/F1 | — | — |
| mIoU | — | — |
| Mean accuracy | — | — |
| Mean precision | — | — |
| Mean Dice | — | — |
| Mean specificity | — | — |
| Pixel accuracy | — | — |
| Frequency-weighted IoU | — | — |
| Fixed GT-present class mIoU | — | — |
| Boundary F1 | — | — |

The selected checkpoint has independent evaluation evidence. Final values are the trainer's final validation record, not a new independent evaluation. mIoU averages classes with nonzero union, so false positives on absent classes can change its denominator. The fixed GT-class mean is supplementary and excludes absent classes; their false positives remain in the confusion matrix.

### Resource usage and timing

| Measurement | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Peak training VRAM, retained training invocation (GiB) | — |
| Peak evaluation VRAM (GiB) | — |
| Retained training invocation wall time (seconds) | — |
| Retained training invocation GPU-hours (one GPU) | — |
| Evaluation wall time (seconds) | — |
| Full evaluation pipeline images/second | — |
| Best full-state checkpoint (MiB) | — |
| Final full-state checkpoint (MiB) | — |
| Audited periodic checkpoints removed (GiB) | — |

VRAM uses the recorded allocator high-water mark; it is not total device usage including CUDA context. Resumed jobs' retained training invocation times and peaks are **not whole-campaign totals**. Earlier invocation resource records are not reconstructed here. Evaluation throughput includes loader, sliding-window inference and metrics; it is not model-only latency/FPS. Missing measurements are shown as —, never inferred from another dataset's run.

### Standardized inference performance

Dedicated model-only profiling waits for an idle worker-locked L40S: BF16, batch 1, 1024x1024, 20 warmup and 100 CUDA-event-timed public forwards. It excludes loading, preprocessing, tiling and metrics.

| Status | Parameters | Weight MiB | FPS | p50 ms | p95 ms | Peak reserved GiB |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| waiting_for_idle_gpu | — | — | — | — | — | — |

```json
{
  "status": "waiting_for_idle_gpu",
  "contract": "L40S; batch 1; 1024x1024; BF16; 20 warmup; 100 timed forwards"
}
```

### Per-class validation results

| Class | GT pixels | IoU (%) | Precision (%) | Recall (%) | Dice (%) | Boundary F1 (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

### Validation tracking

| Logged step | Overall mIoU (%) | Mud IoU (%) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 254 | 33.38 | 0.20 |
| 508 | 46.04 | 0.62 |
| 763 | 44.01 | 1.71 |
| 1017 | 43.94 | 0.75 |
| 1272 | 43.71 | 1.16 |
| 1527 | 43.27 | 2.47 |

All retained scalar curves, including training loss and per-class IoU, are in record.json. Observed best mud on a curve is not necessarily a retained checkpoint: the pilot saved its selection-metric-best and final checkpoints. Step logging and checkpoint global_step may differ by one.

## railsem19_to_rtis — seed 1

Status: **training**. Started: 2026-09-07T12:49:31.851384+00:00. Finished: —.

Recipe pretrained initializer: `openmmlab/upernet-convnext-small`.

`rtis_only` uses the recipe initializer, which may include pretrained segmentation components. Transfer paths load the exact historical source checkpoint below and reset the classifier; they do not reset all query/decoder features.

Source checkpoint: `{'name': 'upernet_convnext--railsem19--seed-0', 'model': 'upernet_convnext', 'protocol': 'railsem19', 'config': '/data/izadia1/projects/segmentary-runs/all-model-city-rail-seed0-rail20-b9eb3e1/accepted/upernet_convnext--railsem19--seed-0/resolved-config.yaml', 'checkpoint': '/data/izadia1/projects/segmentary-runs/all-model-city-rail-seed0-a7c0b67/jobs/upernet_convnext--railsem19--seed-0/attempt-001/train/upernet_convnext--railsem19_seed0/railsem19/last.ckpt', 'recorded_sha256': '6e246e8e61f02c4359f944d776168359392cec5c1c750d4ba29c6637f80b9f3a', 'exists': True}`.

Config SHA-256: `eae701ab60a3802ed357c03812f09a474e36bb48b50920aa0322abf8b11f4091`. Weights used for validation: `—`.

### Mud-pumping and aggregate quality

| Metric | Selected checkpoint | Final training validation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mud IoU | — | — |
| Mud precision | — | — |
| Mud recall | — | — |
| Mud Dice/F1 | — | — |
| mIoU | — | — |
| Mean accuracy | — | — |
| Mean precision | — | — |
| Mean Dice | — | — |
| Mean specificity | — | — |
| Pixel accuracy | — | — |
| Frequency-weighted IoU | — | — |
| Fixed GT-present class mIoU | — | — |
| Boundary F1 | — | — |

The selected checkpoint has independent evaluation evidence. Final values are the trainer's final validation record, not a new independent evaluation. mIoU averages classes with nonzero union, so false positives on absent classes can change its denominator. The fixed GT-class mean is supplementary and excludes absent classes; their false positives remain in the confusion matrix.

### Resource usage and timing

| Measurement | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Peak training VRAM, retained training invocation (GiB) | — |
| Peak evaluation VRAM (GiB) | — |
| Retained training invocation wall time (seconds) | — |
| Retained training invocation GPU-hours (one GPU) | — |
| Evaluation wall time (seconds) | — |
| Full evaluation pipeline images/second | — |
| Best full-state checkpoint (MiB) | — |
| Final full-state checkpoint (MiB) | — |
| Audited periodic checkpoints removed (GiB) | — |

VRAM uses the recorded allocator high-water mark; it is not total device usage including CUDA context. Resumed jobs' retained training invocation times and peaks are **not whole-campaign totals**. Earlier invocation resource records are not reconstructed here. Evaluation throughput includes loader, sliding-window inference and metrics; it is not model-only latency/FPS. Missing measurements are shown as —, never inferred from another dataset's run.

### Standardized inference performance

Dedicated model-only profiling waits for an idle worker-locked L40S: BF16, batch 1, 1024x1024, 20 warmup and 100 CUDA-event-timed public forwards. It excludes loading, preprocessing, tiling and metrics.

| Status | Parameters | Weight MiB | FPS | p50 ms | p95 ms | Peak reserved GiB |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| waiting_for_idle_gpu | — | — | — | — | — | — |

```json
{
  "status": "waiting_for_idle_gpu",
  "contract": "L40S; batch 1; 1024x1024; BF16; 20 warmup; 100 timed forwards"
}
```

### Per-class validation results

| Class | GT pixels | IoU (%) | Precision (%) | Recall (%) | Dice (%) | Boundary F1 (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

### Validation tracking

| Logged step | Overall mIoU (%) | Mud IoU (%) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 254 | 31.46 | 0.63 |
| 508 | 40.83 | 1.03 |
| 763 | 44.12 | 0.48 |

All retained scalar curves, including training loss and per-class IoU, are in record.json. Observed best mud on a curve is not necessarily a retained checkpoint: the pilot saved its selection-metric-best and final checkpoints. Step logging and checkpoint global_step may differ by one.

### Stopping and checkpoint provenance

```json
{
  "stopping": null,
  "checkpoints": null,
  "cleanup_error": null
}
```

### Resolved training, initialization and evaluation settings

The optimizer block is the base configuration. Stage LR scales are applied at runtime, and stage warmup is capped at min(base warmup, floor(stage budget / 10), stage budget - 1): 400 steps for this 4,000-step pilot. Model-internal native input grids may differ from augmentation crops (EoMT uses its 640 grid).

### Mud-pumping and aggregate quality

| Metric | Selected checkpoint | Final training validation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mud IoU | — | — |
| Mud precision | — | — |
| Mud recall | — | — |
| Mud Dice/F1 | — | — |
| mIoU | — | — |
| Mean accuracy | — | — |
| Mean precision | — | — |
| Mean Dice | — | — |
| Mean specificity | — | — |
| Pixel accuracy | — | — |
| Frequency-weighted IoU | — | — |
| Fixed GT-present class mIoU | — | — |
| Boundary F1 | — | — |

The selected checkpoint has independent evaluation evidence. Final values are the trainer's final validation record, not a new independent evaluation. mIoU averages classes with nonzero union, so false positives on absent classes can change its denominator. The fixed GT-class mean is supplementary and excludes absent classes; their false positives remain in the confusion matrix.

### Resource usage and timing

| Measurement | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Peak training VRAM, retained training invocation (GiB) | — |
| Peak evaluation VRAM (GiB) | — |
| Retained training invocation wall time (seconds) | — |
| Retained training invocation GPU-hours (one GPU) | — |
| Evaluation wall time (seconds) | — |
| Full evaluation pipeline images/second | — |
| Best full-state checkpoint (MiB) | — |
| Final full-state checkpoint (MiB) | — |
| Audited periodic checkpoints removed (GiB) | — |

VRAM uses the recorded allocator high-water mark; it is not total device usage including CUDA context. Resumed jobs' retained training invocation times and peaks are **not whole-campaign totals**. Earlier invocation resource records are not reconstructed here. Evaluation throughput includes loader, sliding-window inference and metrics; it is not model-only latency/FPS. Missing measurements are shown as —, never inferred from another dataset's run.

### Standardized inference performance

Dedicated model-only profiling waits for an idle worker-locked L40S: BF16, batch 1, 1024x1024, 20 warmup and 100 CUDA-event-timed public forwards. It excludes loading, preprocessing, tiling and metrics.

| Status | Parameters | Weight MiB | FPS | p50 ms | p95 ms | Peak reserved GiB |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| waiting_for_idle_gpu | — | — | — | — | — | — |

```json
{
  "status": "waiting_for_idle_gpu",
  "contract": "L40S; batch 1; 1024x1024; BF16; 20 warmup; 100 timed forwards"

```

### Per-class validation results

| Class | GT pixels | IoU (%) | Precision (%) | Recall (%) | Dice (%) | Boundary F1 (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

### Validation tracking

| Logged step | Overall mIoU (%) | Mud IoU (%) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 254 | 31.16 | 0.25 |

All retained scalar curves, including training loss and per-class IoU, are in record.json. Observed best mud on a curve is not necessarily a retained checkpoint: the pilot saved its selection-metric-best and final checkpoints. Step logging and checkpoint global_step may differ by one.

### Resolved training, initialization and evaluation settings

The optimizer block is the base configuration. Stage LR scales are applied at runtime, and stage warmup is capped at min(base warmup, floor(stage budget / 10), stage budget - 1): 400 steps for this 4,000-step pilot. Model-internal native input grids may differ from augmentation crops (EoMT uses its 640 grid).
