### Mud-pumping and aggregate quality

| Metric | Selected checkpoint | Final training validation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mud IoU | — | — |
| Mud precision | — | — |
| Mud recall | — | — |
| Mud Dice/F1 | — | — |
| mIoU | — | — |
| Mean accuracy | — | — |
| Mean precision | — | — |
| Mean Dice | — | — |
| Mean specificity | — | — |
| Pixel accuracy | — | — |
| Frequency-weighted IoU | — | — |
| Fixed GT-present class mIoU | — | — |
| Boundary F1 | — | — |

The selected checkpoint has independent evaluation evidence. Final values are the trainer's final validation record, not a new independent evaluation. mIoU averages classes with nonzero union, so false positives on absent classes can change its denominator. The fixed GT-class mean is supplementary and excludes absent classes; their false positives remain in the confusion matrix.

### Resource usage and timing

| Measurement | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Peak training VRAM, retained training invocation (GiB) | — |
| Peak evaluation VRAM (GiB) | — |
| Retained training invocation wall time (seconds) | — |
| Retained training invocation GPU-hours (one GPU) | — |
| Evaluation wall time (seconds) | — |
| Full evaluation pipeline images/second | — |
| Best full-state checkpoint (MiB) | — |
| Final full-state checkpoint (MiB) | — |
| Audited periodic checkpoints removed (GiB) | — |

VRAM uses the recorded allocator high-water mark; it is not total device usage including CUDA context. Resumed jobs' retained training invocation times and peaks are **not whole-campaign totals**. Earlier invocation resource records are not reconstructed here. Evaluation throughput includes loader, sliding-window inference and metrics; it is not model-only latency/FPS. Missing measurements are shown as —, never inferred from another dataset's run.

### Standardized inference performance

Dedicated model-only profiling waits for an idle worker-locked L40S: BF16, batch 1, 1024x1024, 20 warmup and 100 CUDA-event-timed public forwards. It excludes loading, preprocessing, tiling and metrics.

| Status | Parameters | Weight MiB | FPS | p50 ms | p95 ms | Peak reserved GiB |

### Per-class validation results

| Class | GT pixels | IoU (%) | Precision (%) | Recall (%) | Dice (%) | Boundary F1 (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

### Validation tracking

| Logged step | Overall mIoU (%) | Mud IoU (%) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 254 | 17.66 | 0.69 |
| 508 | 19.81 | 0.18 |
| 763 | 20.39 | 1.96 |
| 1017 | 23.49 | 0.14 |

All retained scalar curves, including training loss and per-class IoU, are in record.json. Observed best mud on a curve is not necessarily a retained checkpoint: the pilot saved its selection-metric-best and final checkpoints. Step logging and checkpoint global_step may differ by one.

### Stopping and checkpoint provenance

```json

  "stopping": null,
  "checkpoints": null,
  "cleanup_error": null

```

### Resolved training, initialization and evaluation settings

The optimizer block is the base configuration. Stage LR scales are applied at runtime, and stage warmup is capped at min(base warmup, floor(stage budget / 10), stage budget - 1): 400 steps for this 4,000-step pilot. Model-internal native input grids may differ from augmentation crops (EoMT uses its 640 grid).

VRAM uses the recorded allocator high-water mark; it is not total device usage including CUDA context. Resumed jobs' retained training invocation times and peaks are **not whole-campaign totals**. Earlier invocation resource records are not reconstructed here. Evaluation throughput includes loader, sliding-window inference and metrics; it is not model-only latency/FPS. Missing measurements are shown as —, never inferred from another dataset's run.

### Standardized inference performance

Dedicated model-only profiling waits for an idle worker-locked L40S: BF16, batch 1, 1024x1024, 20 warmup and 100 CUDA-event-timed public forwards. It excludes loading, preprocessing, tiling and metrics.

### Per-class validation results

| Class | GT pixels | IoU (%) | Precision (%) | Recall (%) | Dice (%) | Boundary F1 (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

### Validation tracking

| Logged step | Overall mIoU (%) | Mud IoU (%) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 254 | 18.44 | 0.40 |
| 508 | 21.48 | 4.53 |
| 763 | 21.01 | 2.10 |

All retained scalar curves, including training loss and per-class IoU, are in record.json. Observed best mud on a curve is not necessarily a retained checkpoint: the pilot saved its selection-metric-best and final checkpoints. Step logging and checkpoint global_step may differ by one.

### Stopping and checkpoint provenance

### Resolved training, initialization and evaluation settings

The optimizer block is the base configuration. Stage LR scales are applied at runtime, and stage warmup is capped at min(base warmup, floor(stage budget / 10), stage budget - 1): 400 steps for this 4,000-step pilot. Model-internal native input grids may differ from augmentation crops (EoMT uses its 640 grid).

### Mud-pumping and aggregate quality

The selected checkpoint has independent evaluation evidence. Final values are the trainer's final validation record, not a new independent evaluation. mIoU averages classes with nonzero union, so false positives on absent classes can change its denominator. The fixed GT-class mean is supplementary and excludes absent classes; their false positives remain in the confusion matrix.

## cityscapes_to_rtis — seed 2

Status: **training**. Started: 2026-09-07T10:01:38.866354+00:00. Finished: —.

Recipe pretrained initializer: `{"arch": "smp", "backbone_path": null, "batch_norm_momentum": null, "checkpoint": null, "classifier_path": null, "drop_path": null, "encoder_name": "efficientnet-b0", "encoder_weights": "imagenet", "head": "unified_head", "head_paths": [], "inactive_parameter_paths": ["encoder._conv_head", "encoder._bn1"], "local_files_only": false, "lora_alpha": 32, "lora_dropout": 0.05, "lora_r": 16, "lora_targets": [], "native": null, "revision": null, "smp_arch": "UnetPlusPlus", "subfolder": null, "trust_remote_code": false, "tuning": "full"}`.

`rtis_only` uses the recipe initializer, which may include pretrained segmentation components. Transfer paths load the exact historical source checkpoint below and reset the classifier; they do not reset all query/decoder features.

Source checkpoint: `{'name': 'smp_unetplusplus_efficientnet_b0--cityscapes--seed-0', 'model': 'smp_unetplusplus_efficientnet_b0', 'protocol': 'cityscapes', 'config': '/data/izadia1/projects/segmentary-runs/all-model-city-rail-seed0-rail20-b9eb3e1/jobs/smp_unetplusplus_efficientnet_b0--cityscapes--seed-0/attempt-001/resolved-config.yaml', 'checkpoint': '/data/izadia1/projects/segmentary-runs/all-model-city-rail-seed0-rail20-b9eb3e1/jobs/smp_unetplusplus_efficientnet_b0--cityscapes--seed-0/attempt-001/train/smp_unetplusplus_efficientnet_b0--cityscapes_seed0/cityscapes/last.ckpt', 'recorded_sha256': 'af0359a15da63814d52e95356a33220584bc6751bb14cfdf82601e0b7b7e6ae1', 'exists': True}`.

Config SHA-256: `97b2ef2265aeffea83515078eaf339e0ba9ad13e63ea5a41be0a8aaddc7663d2`. Weights used for validation: `—`.

### Mud-pumping and aggregate quality

| Metric | Selected checkpoint | Final training validation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mud IoU | — | — |
| Mud precision | — | — |
| Mud recall | — | — |
| Mud Dice/F1 | — | — |
| mIoU | — | — |
| Mean accuracy | — | — |
| Mean precision | — | — |
| Mean Dice | — | — |
| Mean specificity | — | — |
| Pixel accuracy | — | — |
| Frequency-weighted IoU | — | — |
| Fixed GT-present class mIoU | — | — |
| Boundary F1 | — | — |

The selected checkpoint has independent evaluation evidence. Final values are the trainer's final validation record, not a new independent evaluation. mIoU averages classes with nonzero union, so false positives on absent classes can change its denominator. The fixed GT-class mean is supplementary and excludes absent classes; their false positives remain in the confusion matrix.

### Resource usage and timing

| Measurement | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Peak training VRAM, retained training invocation (GiB) | — |
| Peak evaluation VRAM (GiB) | — |
| Retained training invocation wall time (seconds) | — |
| Retained training invocation GPU-hours (one GPU) | — |
| Evaluation wall time (seconds) | — |
| Full evaluation pipeline images/second | — |
| Best full-state checkpoint (MiB) | — |
| Final full-state checkpoint (MiB) | — |
| Audited periodic checkpoints removed (GiB) | — |

VRAM uses the recorded allocator high-water mark; it is not total device usage including CUDA context. Resumed jobs' retained training invocation times and peaks are **not whole-campaign totals**. Earlier invocation resource records are not reconstructed here. Evaluation throughput includes loader, sliding-window inference and metrics; it is not model-only latency/FPS. Missing measurements are shown as —, never inferred from another dataset's run.

### Standardized inference performance

Dedicated model-only profiling waits for an idle worker-locked L40S: BF16, batch 1, 1024x1024, 20 warmup and 100 CUDA-event-timed public forwards. It excludes loading, preprocessing, tiling and metrics.

| Status | Parameters | Weight MiB | FPS | p50 ms | p95 ms | Peak reserved GiB |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| waiting_for_idle_gpu | — | — | — | — | — | — |

```json
{
  "status": "waiting_for_idle_gpu",
  "contract": "L40S; batch 1; 1024x1024; BF16; 20 warmup; 100 timed forwards"

### Per-class validation results

| Class | GT pixels | IoU (%) | Precision (%) | Recall (%) | Dice (%) | Boundary F1 (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

### Validation tracking

| Logged step | Overall mIoU (%) | Mud IoU (%) |
| --- | --- | --- |

All retained scalar curves, including training loss and per-class IoU, are in record.json. Observed best mud on a curve is not necessarily a retained checkpoint: the pilot saved its selection-metric-best and final checkpoints. Step logging and checkpoint global_step may differ by one.

### Stopping and checkpoint provenance

```json
{
  "stopping": null,
  "checkpoints": null,
  "cleanup_error": null
}
```

### Resolved training, initialization and evaluation settings

The optimizer block is the base configuration. Stage LR scales are applied at runtime, and stage warmup is capped at min(base warmup, floor(stage budget / 10), stage budget - 1): 400 steps for this 4,000-step pilot. Model-internal native input grids may differ from augmentation crops (EoMT uses its 640 grid).

Status: **queued**. Started: —. Finished: —.

Recipe pretrained initializer: `{"arch": "smp", "backbone_path": null, "batch_norm_momentum": null, "checkpoint": null, "classifier_path": null, "drop_path": null, "encoder_name": "efficientnet-b0", "encoder_weights": "imagenet", "head": "unified_head", "head_paths": [], "inactive_parameter_paths": ["encoder._conv_head", "encoder._bn1"], "local_files_only": false, "lora_alpha": 32, "lora_dropout": 0.05, "lora_r": 16, "lora_targets": [], "native": null, "revision": null, "smp_arch": "UnetPlusPlus", "subfolder": null, "trust_remote_code": false, "tuning": "full"}`.

`rtis_only` uses the recipe initializer, which may include pretrained segmentation components. Transfer paths load the exact historical source checkpoint below and reset the classifier; they do not reset all query/decoder features.

Config SHA-256: `2ccd92581bcdc32df9cb6225b20fab9025027ff732fc9689ebe1778b8b1961ca`. Weights used for validation: `—`.

### Mud-pumping and aggregate quality

| Metric | Selected checkpoint | Final training validation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mud IoU | — | — |
| Mud precision | — | — |
| Mud recall | — | — |
| Mud Dice/F1 | — | — |
| mIoU | — | — |
| Mean accuracy | — | — |
| Mean precision | — | — |
| Mean Dice | — | — |
| Mean specificity | — | — |
| Pixel accuracy | — | — |
| Frequency-weighted IoU | — | — |
| Fixed GT-present class mIoU | — | — |
| Boundary F1 | — | — |

The selected checkpoint has independent evaluation evidence. Final values are the trainer's final validation record, not a new independent evaluation. mIoU averages classes with nonzero union, so false positives on absent classes can change its denominator. The fixed GT-class mean is supplementary and excludes absent classes; their false positives remain in the confusion matrix.

### Resource usage and timing

| Measurement | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Peak training VRAM, retained training invocation (GiB) | — |
| Peak evaluation VRAM (GiB) | — |
| Retained training invocation wall time (seconds) | — |
| Retained training invocation GPU-hours (one GPU) | — |
| Evaluation wall time (seconds) | — |
| Full evaluation pipeline images/second | — |
| Best full-state checkpoint (MiB) | — |
| Final full-state checkpoint (MiB) | — |
| Audited periodic checkpoints removed (GiB) | — |

VRAM uses the recorded allocator high-water mark; it is not total device usage including CUDA context. Resumed jobs' retained training invocation times and peaks are **not whole-campaign totals**. Earlier invocation resource records are not reconstructed here. Evaluation throughput includes loader, sliding-window inference and metrics; it is not model-only latency/FPS. Missing measurements are shown as —, never inferred from another dataset's run.

### Standardized inference performance

Dedicated model-only profiling waits for an idle worker-locked L40S: BF16, batch 1, 1024x1024, 20 warmup and 100 CUDA-event-timed public forwards. It excludes loading, preprocessing, tiling and metrics.

| Status | Parameters | Weight MiB | FPS | p50 ms | p95 ms | Peak reserved GiB |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| waiting_for_idle_gpu | — | — | — | — | — | — |

```json
{
  "status": "waiting_for_idle_gpu",

### Per-class validation results

| Class | GT pixels | IoU (%) | Precision (%) | Recall (%) | Dice (%) | Boundary F1 (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

### Validation tracking

| Logged step | Overall mIoU (%) | Mud IoU (%) |
| --- | --- | --- |

All retained scalar curves, including training loss and per-class IoU, are in record.json. Observed best mud on a curve is not necessarily a retained checkpoint: the pilot saved its selection-metric-best and final checkpoints. Step logging and checkpoint global_step may differ by one.

### Stopping and checkpoint provenance

```json
{
  "stopping": null,
  "checkpoints": null,
  "cleanup_error": null
}
```

### Resolved training, initialization and evaluation settings

The optimizer block is the base configuration. Stage LR scales are applied at runtime, and stage warmup is capped at min(base warmup, floor(stage budget / 10), stage budget - 1): 400 steps for this 4,000-step pilot. Model-internal native input grids may differ from augmentation crops (EoMT uses its 640 grid).

The selected checkpoint has independent evaluation evidence.

The fixed GT-class mean is supplementary and excludes absent classes; their false positives remain in the confusion matrix.

### Resource usage and timing

| Measurement | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Peak training VRAM, retained training invocation (GiB) | — |
| Peak evaluation VRAM (GiB) | — |
| Retained training invocation wall time (seconds) | — |
| Retained training invocation GPU-hours (one GPU) | — |
| Evaluation wall time (seconds) | — |
| Full evaluation pipeline images/second | — |
| Best full-state checkpoint (MiB) | — |
| Final full-state checkpoint (MiB) | — |
| Audited periodic checkpoints removed (GiB) | — |

VRAM uses the recorded allocator high-water mark; it is not total device usage including CUDA context. Resumed jobs' retained training invocation times and peaks are **not whole-campaign totals**. Earlier invocation resource records are not reconstructed here. Evaluation throughput includes loader, sliding-window inference and metrics; it is not model-only latency/FPS. Missing measurements are shown as —, never inferred from another dataset's run.

### Standardized inference performance

Dedicated model-only profiling waits for an idle worker-locked L40S: BF16, batch 1, 1024x1024, 20 warmup and 100 CUDA-event-timed public forwards. It excludes loading, preprocessing, tiling and metrics.

### Per-class validation results

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

### Validation tracking

| Logged step | Overall mIoU (%) | Mud IoU (%) |
| --- | --- | --- |

All retained scalar curves, including training loss and per-class IoU, are in record.json. Observed best mud on a curve is not necessarily a retained checkpoint: the pilot saved its selection-metric-best and final checkpoints. Step logging and checkpoint global_step may differ by one.

### Stopping and checkpoint provenance

### Resolved training, initialization and evaluation settings

The optimizer block is the base configuration. Stage LR scales are applied at runtime, and stage warmup is capped at min(base warmup, floor(stage budget / 10), stage budget - 1): 400 steps for this 4,000-step pilot. Model-internal native input grids may differ from augmentation crops (EoMT uses its 640 grid).
