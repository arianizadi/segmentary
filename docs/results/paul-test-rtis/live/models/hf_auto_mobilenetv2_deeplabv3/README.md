# hf_auto_mobilenetv2_deeplabv3 — paul-test-rtis

[RTIS comparison](../../README.md) · [Full model records](record.json)

Mud-pumping detection is the primary application. Current pilot checkpoints were selected by overall validation mIoU, **not mud IoU**. All numbers here describe that existing policy; a mud-focused experiment must be explicitly versioned.

| Model | Initialization path | Status | Steps | Best step | Mud IoU (%) | Mud precision (%) | Mud recall (%) | Final mud IoU (trainer val, %) | mIoU (%) | Fixed GT-class mIoU (%) |

## rtis_only

Status: **training**. Started: 2026-09-06T03:01:01.332213+00:00. Finished: —.

Recipe pretrained initializer: `google/deeplabv3_mobilenet_v2_1.0_513`.

`rtis_only` uses the recipe initializer, which may include pretrained segmentation components. Transfer paths load the exact historical source checkpoint below and reset the classifier; they do not reset all query/decoder features.

Source checkpoint: `Recipe pretrained initialization`.

Config SHA-256: `2bb0ec7a862af1c70e004aa4f5d101238b9e092b28c399e0fe831476958c107e`. Weights used for validation: `—`.

### Mud-pumping and aggregate quality

| Metric | Selected checkpoint | Final training validation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mud IoU | — | — |
| Mud precision | — | — |
| Mud recall | — | — |
| Mud Dice/F1 | — | — |
| mIoU | — | — |
| Mean accuracy | — | — |
| Mean precision | — | — |
| Mean Dice | — | — |
| Mean specificity | — | — |
| Pixel accuracy | — | — |
| Frequency-weighted IoU | — | — |
| Fixed GT-present class mIoU | — | — |
| Boundary F1 | — | — |

The selected checkpoint has independent evaluation evidence. Final values are the trainer's final validation record, not a new independent evaluation. mIoU averages classes with nonzero union, so false positives on absent classes can change its denominator. The fixed GT-class mean is supplementary and excludes absent classes; their false positives remain in the confusion matrix.

### Resource usage and timing

| Measurement | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Peak training VRAM, retained training invocation (GiB) | — |
| Peak evaluation VRAM (GiB) | — |
| Retained training invocation wall time (seconds) | — |
| Retained training invocation GPU-hours (one GPU) | — |
| Evaluation wall time (seconds) | — |
| Full evaluation pipeline images/second | — |
| Best full-state checkpoint (MiB) | — |
| Final full-state checkpoint (MiB) | — |
| Audited periodic checkpoints removed (GiB) | — |

VRAM uses the recorded allocator high-water mark; it is not total device usage including CUDA context. Resumed jobs' retained training invocation times and peaks are **not whole-campaign totals**. Earlier invocation resource records are not reconstructed here. Evaluation throughput includes loader, sliding-window inference and metrics; it is not model-only latency/FPS. Missing measurements are shown as —, never inferred from another dataset's run.

### Standardized inference performance

Dedicated model-only profiling waits for an idle worker-locked L40S: BF16, batch 1, 1024x1024, 20 warmup and 100 CUDA-event-timed public forwards. It excludes loading, preprocessing, tiling and metrics.

| Status | Parameters | Weight MiB | FPS | p50 ms | p95 ms | Peak reserved GiB |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| waiting_for_idle_gpu | — | — | — | — | — | — |

```json
{
  "status": "waiting_for_idle_gpu",
  "contract": "L40S; batch 1; 1024x1024; BF16; 20 warmup; 100 timed forwards"
}
```

### Per-class validation results

| Class | GT pixels | IoU (%) | Precision (%) | Recall (%) | Dice (%) | Boundary F1 (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

### Validation tracking

| Logged step | Overall mIoU (%) | Mud IoU (%) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 254 | 14.27 | 0.17 |
| 508 | 17.53 | 0.10 |
| 763 | 17.04 | 0.15 |
| 1017 | 18.56 | 0.22 |

All retained scalar curves, including training loss and per-class IoU, are in record.json. Observed best mud on a curve is not necessarily a retained checkpoint: this pilot saved the aggregate-best and final checkpoints. Step logging and checkpoint global_step may differ by one.

### Stopping and checkpoint provenance

```json
{
  "stopping": null,
  "checkpoints": null,
  "cleanup_error": null
}
```

### Resolved training, initialization and evaluation settings

The optimizer block is the base configuration. Stage LR scales are applied at runtime, and stage warmup is capped at min(base warmup, floor(stage budget / 10), stage budget - 1): 400 steps for this 4,000-step pilot. Model-internal native input grids may differ from augmentation crops (EoMT uses its 640 grid).

### Per-class validation results

| Class | GT pixels | IoU (%) | Precision (%) | Recall (%) | Dice (%) | Boundary F1 (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

### Validation tracking

| Logged step | Overall mIoU (%) | Mud IoU (%) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 254 | 22.48 | 1.09 |
| 508 | 25.51 | 2.29 |

All retained scalar curves, including training loss and per-class IoU, are in record.json. Observed best mud on a curve is not necessarily a retained checkpoint: this pilot saved the aggregate-best and final checkpoints. Step logging and checkpoint global_step may differ by one.

### Resolved training, initialization and evaluation settings

The optimizer block is the base configuration. Stage LR scales are applied at runtime, and stage warmup is capped at min(base warmup, floor(stage budget / 10), stage budget - 1): 400 steps for this 4,000-step pilot. Model-internal native input grids may differ from augmentation crops (EoMT uses its 640 grid).

## cityscapes_to_railsem19_to_rtis

Status: **training**. Started: 2026-09-06T03:09:05.145117+00:00. Finished: —.

Recipe pretrained initializer: `google/deeplabv3_mobilenet_v2_1.0_513`.

`rtis_only` uses the recipe initializer, which may include pretrained segmentation components. Transfer paths load the exact historical source checkpoint below and reset the classifier; they do not reset all query/decoder features.

Source checkpoint: `{'name': 'hf_auto_mobilenetv2_deeplabv3--cityscapes_to_railsem19--seed-0', 'model': 'hf_auto_mobilenetv2_deeplabv3', 'protocol': 'cityscapes_to_railsem19', 'config': '/data/izadia1/projects/segmentary-runs/all-model-city-rail-seed0-rail20-b9eb3e1/jobs/hf_auto_mobilenetv2_deeplabv3--cityscapes_to_railsem19--seed-0/attempt-001/resolved-config.yaml', 'checkpoint': '/data/izadia1/projects/segmentary-runs/all-model-city-rail-seed0-rail20-b9eb3e1/jobs/hf_auto_mobilenetv2_deeplabv3--cityscapes_to_railsem19--seed-0/attempt-001/train/hf_auto_mobilenetv2_deeplabv3--cityscapes_to_railsem19_seed0/railsem19/last.bn-recalibrated.ckpt', 'recorded_sha256': '2671491cfd7ee6602687c37110da7b0e85183c7fe0bb5aa429ca8541f2a7ce35', 'exists': True}`.

Config SHA-256: `5f304df0d5d959b99830e543a1a1d1039fb65fada91345aac742bda61d3db47c`. Weights used for validation: `—`.

### Mud-pumping and aggregate quality

| Metric | Selected checkpoint | Final training validation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mud IoU | — | — |
| Mud precision | — | — |
| Mud recall | — | — |
| Mud Dice/F1 | — | — |
| mIoU | — | — |
| Mean accuracy | — | — |
| Mean precision | — | — |
| Mean Dice | — | — |
| Mean specificity | — | — |
| Pixel accuracy | — | — |
| Frequency-weighted IoU | — | — |
| Fixed GT-present class mIoU | — | — |
| Boundary F1 | — | — |

The selected checkpoint has independent evaluation evidence. Final values are the trainer's final validation record, not a new independent evaluation. mIoU averages classes with nonzero union, so false positives on absent classes can change its denominator. The fixed GT-class mean is supplementary and excludes absent classes; their false positives remain in the confusion matrix.

### Resource usage and timing

| Measurement | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Peak training VRAM, retained training invocation (GiB) | — |
| Peak evaluation VRAM (GiB) | — |
| Retained training invocation wall time (seconds) | — |
| Retained training invocation GPU-hours (one GPU) | — |
| Evaluation wall time (seconds) | — |
| Full evaluation pipeline images/second | — |
| Best full-state checkpoint (MiB) | — |
| Final full-state checkpoint (MiB) | — |
| Audited periodic checkpoints removed (GiB) | — |

VRAM uses the recorded allocator high-water mark; it is not total device usage including CUDA context. Resumed jobs' retained training invocation times and peaks are **not whole-campaign totals**. Earlier invocation resource records are not reconstructed here. Evaluation throughput includes loader, sliding-window inference and metrics; it is not model-only latency/FPS. Missing measurements are shown as —, never inferred from another dataset's run.

Dedicated model-only profiling waits for an idle worker-locked L40S: BF16, batch 1, 1024x1024, 20 warmup and 100 CUDA-event-timed public forwards. It excludes loading, preprocessing, tiling and metrics.

All retained scalar curves, including training loss and per-class IoU, are in record.json. Observed best mud on a curve is not necessarily a retained checkpoint: this pilot saved the aggregate-best and final checkpoints. Step logging and checkpoint global_step may differ by one.
