# hf_auto_upernet_swin_tiny — paul-test-rtis_v2

[RTIS comparison](../../README.md) · [Full model records](record.json)

Primary selection and early stopping: **mud-pumping validation IoU**. A job is complete only after full statistics and isolated profiling are verified.

Training code: `066afb2626398b7be59d4d19f5a0e4644fd59adc`. Split SHA-256: `18a84c0163a65ded46508bcc904c374e5f33ad8a09b8879e3c8add606e86aa9f`.

## rtis_only — seed 0

Status: **training**. Started: 2026-09-09T20:37:03.187086+00:00. Finished: —.

Recipe pretrained initializer: `openmmlab/upernet-swin-tiny`.

`rtis_only` uses the recipe initializer, which may include pretrained segmentation components. Transfer paths load the exact historical source checkpoint below and reset the classifier; they do not reset all query/decoder features.

Source checkpoint: `Recipe pretrained initialization`.

Config SHA-256: `06f04dfb6708a6bec348cd68ff65f7b88e07330e0ee3f92c6a234f7caff0cc58`. Weights used for validation: `—`.

### Mud-pumping and aggregate quality

| Metric | Selected checkpoint | Final training validation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mud IoU | — | — |
| Mud precision | — | — |
| Mud recall | — | — |
| Mud Dice/F1 | — | — |
| mIoU | — | — |
| Mean accuracy | — | — |
| Mean precision | — | — |
| Mean Dice | — | — |
| Mean specificity | — | — |
| Pixel accuracy | — | — |
| Frequency-weighted IoU | — | — |
| Fixed GT-present class mIoU | — | — |
| Boundary F1 | — | — |

The selected checkpoint has independent evaluation evidence. Final values are the trainer's final validation record, not a new independent evaluation. mIoU averages classes with nonzero union, so false positives on absent classes can change its denominator. The fixed GT-class mean is supplementary and excludes absent classes; their false positives remain in the confusion matrix.

### Resource usage and timing

| Measurement | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Peak training VRAM, retained training invocation (GiB) | — |
| Peak evaluation VRAM (GiB) | — |
| Retained training invocation wall time (seconds) | — |
| Retained training invocation GPU-hours (one GPU) | — |
| Evaluation wall time (seconds) | — |
| Full evaluation pipeline images/second | — |
| Best full-state checkpoint (MiB) | — |
| Final full-state checkpoint (MiB) | — |
| Verified periodic checkpoints removed (GiB) | — |

VRAM uses the recorded allocator high-water mark; it is not total device usage including CUDA context. Resumed jobs' retained training invocation times and peaks are **not whole-campaign totals**. Earlier invocation resource records are not reconstructed here. Evaluation throughput includes loader, sliding-window inference and metrics; it is not model-only latency/FPS. Missing measurements are shown as —, never inferred from another dataset's run.

### Standardized inference performance

Dedicated model-only profiling waits for an idle worker-locked L40S: BF16, batch 1, 1024x1024, 20 warmup and 100 CUDA-event-timed public forwards. It excludes loading, preprocessing, tiling and metrics.

| Status | Parameters | Weight MiB | FPS | p50 ms | p95 ms | Peak reserved GiB |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| waiting_for_idle_gpu | — | — | — | — | — | — |

```json
{
  "status": "waiting_for_idle_gpu",
  "contract": "L40S; batch 1; 1024x1024; BF16; 20 warmup; 100 timed forwards"
}
```

### Per-class validation results

| Class | GT pixels | IoU (%) | Precision (%) | Recall (%) | Dice (%) | Boundary F1 (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

### Validation tracking

| Logged step | Overall mIoU (%) | Mud IoU (%) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 254 | 28.23 | 1.83 |
| 509 | 29.25 | 2.66 |
| 764 | 34.15 | 5.35 |
| 1019 | 32.79 | 5.50 |
| 1274 | 33.30 | 12.42 |
| 1529 | 32.42 | 6.36 |
| 1784 | 33.46 | 2.32 |
| 2038 | 31.77 | 3.11 |

All retained scalar curves, including training loss and per-class IoU, are in record.json. Observed best mud on a curve is not necessarily a retained checkpoint: the pilot saved its selection-metric-best and final checkpoints. Step logging and checkpoint global_step may differ by one.

### Stopping and checkpoint provenance

```json

  "stopping": null,
  "checkpoints": null,
  "cleanup_error": null

```

### Resolved training, initialization and evaluation settings

The optimizer block is the base configuration. Stage LR scales are applied at runtime, and stage warmup is capped at min(base warmup, floor(stage budget / 10), stage budget - 1): 400 steps for this 4,000-step pilot. Model-internal native input grids may differ from augmentation crops (EoMT uses its 640 grid).

Final values are the trainer's final validation record, not a new independent evaluation. mIoU averages classes with nonzero union, so false positives on absent classes can change its denominator. The fixed GT-class mean is supplementary and excludes absent classes; their false positives remain in the confusion matrix.

### Resource usage and timing

| Measurement | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Peak training VRAM, retained training invocation (GiB) | 11.71 |
| Peak evaluation VRAM (GiB) | 7.52 |
| Retained training invocation wall time (seconds) | 2031.90 |
| Retained training invocation GPU-hours (one GPU) | 0.56 |
| Evaluation wall time (seconds) | 19.70 |
| Full evaluation pipeline images/second | 1.88 |
| Best full-state checkpoint (MiB) | 900.33 |
| Final full-state checkpoint (MiB) | 900.31 |
| Verified periodic checkpoints removed (GiB) | 2.64 |

VRAM uses the recorded allocator high-water mark; it is not total device usage including CUDA context. Resumed jobs' retained training invocation times and peaks are **not whole-campaign totals**. Earlier invocation resource records are not reconstructed here. Evaluation throughput includes loader, sliding-window inference and metrics; it is not model-only latency/FPS. Missing measurements are shown as —, never inferred from another dataset's run.

### Standardized inference performance

Dedicated model-only profiling waits for an idle worker-locked L40S: BF16, batch 1, 1024x1024, 20 warmup and 100 CUDA-event-timed public forwards. It excludes loading, preprocessing, tiling and metrics.

### Full-run accounting

| Measurement | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Full GPU-reserved wall seconds, all recorded worker attempts | 2247.43 |
| Full reserved GPU-hours | 0.62 |
| Whole-run timing complete | True |

| Phase | Wall seconds including failed attempts |
| --- | --- |
| training | 2039.43 |
| diagnostics | 158.10 |
| performance | 16.51 |

GPU-reserved time includes model loading, training, validation, collection, profiling, checkpoint I/O and orchestration while the worker owns one GPU. It is not GPU kernel-active time. Phase timings and sampled device memory/power/utilization are retained separately; sampled device memory is not the allocator high-water mark.

### Train/validation and raw/EMA diagnostics

| Checkpoint / weights / split | Images | Mud IoU (%) | Mud precision (%) | Mud recall (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| best-auto-train / raw | 205 | 87.79 | 95.58 | 91.50 |
| best-auto-val / raw | 37 | 15.17 | 44.92 | 18.63 |
| best-alternate-val / ema | 37 | 1.86 | 13.83 | 2.10 |
| final-auto-val / raw | 37 | 3.39 | 10.20 | 4.84 |

Train uses the evaluation transform without augmentation. Compare mud train/validation metrics for the same selected weights. Alternate EMA on running-stat BatchNorm is explicitly uncalibrated and is diagnostic only. Score-threshold curves use uncalibrated normalized scores and are pixel-level diagnostics, not event detection rates or a selected deployment operating point.

![Selected-checkpoint validation examples](railsem19_to_rtis--seed-0/best-auto-val/examples.jpg)

Examples are two lowest and two highest mud-IoU positive images, plus up to two negative images with the most false-positive mud pixels. They are targeted diagnostic examples, not random samples. Green: true positive; red: false positive; yellow: false negative. Full predictions remain on HDRFS.

### Validation tracking

| Logged step | Overall mIoU (%) | Mud IoU (%) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 254 | 33.56 | 15.15 |
| 509 | 45.14 | 6.15 |
| 764 | 46.21 | 3.80 |
| 1019 | 46.00 | 4.87 |
| 1274 | 39.81 | 2.24 |
| 1529 | 45.34 | 3.38 |

All retained scalar curves, including training loss and per-class IoU, are in record.json. Observed best mud on a curve is not necessarily a retained checkpoint: the pilot saved its selection-metric-best and final checkpoints. Step logging and checkpoint global_step may differ by one.

### Resolved training, initialization and evaluation settings

The optimizer block is the base configuration. Stage LR scales are applied at runtime, and stage warmup is capped at min(base warmup, floor(stage budget / 10), stage budget - 1): 400 steps for this 4,000-step pilot. Model-internal native input grids may differ from augmentation crops (EoMT uses its 640 grid).

## cityscapes_to_railsem19_to_rtis — seed 0

Status: **training**. Started: 2026-09-09T20:52:15.234288+00:00. Finished: —.

Recipe pretrained initializer: `openmmlab/upernet-swin-tiny`.

`rtis_only` uses the recipe initializer, which may include pretrained segmentation components. Transfer paths load the exact historical source checkpoint below and reset the classifier; they do not reset all query/decoder features.

Source checkpoint: `{'name': 'hf_auto_upernet_swin_tiny--cityscapes_to_railsem19--seed-0', 'model': 'hf_auto_upernet_swin_tiny', 'protocol': 'cityscapes_to_railsem19', 'config': '/data/izadia1/projects/segmentary-runs/all-model-city-rail-seed0-rail20-b9eb3e1/accepted/hf_auto_upernet_swin_tiny--cityscapes_to_railsem19--seed-0/resolved-config.yaml', 'checkpoint': '/data/izadia1/projects/segmentary-runs/city-rail-transfer-rail20/hf_auto_upernet_swin_tiny/railsem19/last.ckpt', 'recorded_sha256': 'ebdfc5ac3d69bb58c8c396908b2b1d3f1c1e6d195f24b3b634a5ea4844173915', 'exists': True}`.

Config SHA-256: `94c9e031bfbbd60d0cbe18cb643ebba515b69f5660ee3e79ec8feaf6207d6852`. Weights used for validation: `—`.

### Mud-pumping and aggregate quality

| Metric | Selected checkpoint | Final training validation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mud IoU | — | — |
| Mud precision | — | — |
| Mud recall | — | — |
| Mud Dice/F1 | — | — |
| mIoU | — | — |
| Mean accuracy | — | — |
| Mean precision | — | — |
| Mean Dice | — | — |
| Mean specificity | — | — |
| Pixel accuracy | — | — |
| Frequency-weighted IoU | — | — |
| Fixed GT-present class mIoU | — | — |
| Boundary F1 | — | — |

The selected checkpoint has independent evaluation evidence. Final values are the trainer's final validation record, not a new independent evaluation. mIoU averages classes with nonzero union, so false positives on absent classes can change its denominator. The fixed GT-class mean is supplementary and excludes absent classes; their false positives remain in the confusion matrix.

### Resource usage and timing

| Measurement | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Peak training VRAM, retained training invocation (GiB) | — |
| Peak evaluation VRAM (GiB) | — |
| Retained training invocation wall time (seconds) | — |
| Retained training invocation GPU-hours (one GPU) | — |
| Evaluation wall time (seconds) | — |
| Full evaluation pipeline images/second | — |
| Best full-state checkpoint (MiB) | — |
| Final full-state checkpoint (MiB) | — |
| Verified periodic checkpoints removed (GiB) | — |

VRAM uses the recorded allocator high-water mark; it is not total device usage including CUDA context. Resumed jobs' retained training invocation times and peaks are **not whole-campaign totals**. Earlier invocation resource records are not reconstructed here. Evaluation throughput includes loader, sliding-window inference and metrics; it is not model-only latency/FPS. Missing measurements are shown as —, never inferred from another dataset's run.

### Standardized inference performance

Dedicated model-only profiling waits for an idle worker-locked L40S: BF16, batch 1, 1024x1024, 20 warmup and 100 CUDA-event-timed public forwards. It excludes loading, preprocessing, tiling and metrics.

| Status | Parameters | Weight MiB | FPS | p50 ms | p95 ms | Peak reserved GiB |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| waiting_for_idle_gpu | — | — | — | — | — | — |

```json
{
  "status": "waiting_for_idle_gpu",
  "contract": "L40S; batch 1; 1024x1024; BF16; 20 warmup; 100 timed forwards"
}
```

### Per-class validation results

| Class | GT pixels | IoU (%) | Precision (%) | Recall (%) | Dice (%) | Boundary F1 (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

### Validation tracking

| Logged step | Overall mIoU (%) | Mud IoU (%) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 254 | 31.62 | 16.28 |
| 509 | 36.01 | 1.25 |
| 764 | 38.92 | 1.65 |
| 1019 | 40.02 | 5.98 |
| 1274 | 36.18 | 4.31 |

All retained scalar curves, including training loss and per-class IoU, are in record.json. Observed best mud on a curve is not necessarily a retained checkpoint: the pilot saved its selection-metric-best and final checkpoints. Step logging and checkpoint global_step may differ by one.

### Stopping and checkpoint provenance
