# Native ResNet-101 + UPer

Recipe: [`native_resnet101_uper.yaml`](../../../../configs/models/native_resnet101_uper.yaml)

UPer adds pyramid pooling to the deepest feature and then fuses the whole
fine-to-coarse hierarchy. Paired with `resnet101.a1_in1k`, this is the high-capacity
native CNN recipe in the initial catalog.

Pros:

- combines global scene context with all four selected scales;
- deeper backbone offers more representational capacity;
- direct identity neck keeps the model graph understandable.

Cons:

- largest backbone parameter count in this native set;
- highest expected training memory/compute among these recipes;
- capacity is wasteful until data and overfit checks are healthy.

## Advanced settings and compatibility

Begin at 256 decoder channels and GroupNorm. Reducing channels is the first
memory lever. Keep `llrd: 1.0`: this is a CNN and no layerwise schedule is
claimed. The four head indices refer to the four selected ResNet outputs.

## Evidence and benchmarks

The exact tagged backbone loaded requested weights without fallback and passed
two CPU feature shapes. UPer has isolated forward/backward tests. The assembled
YAML has parser evidence only; there is no recorded optimizer smoke, memory
measurement, latency result, or common-data mIoU benchmark.

See [native backbones](../../components/native-backbones/README.md),
[native heads](../../components/native-heads/README.md), and the
[smoke ledger](../../../benchmarks/native-component-smokes/README.md).

## Cityscapes and RailSem19 benchmark results

Values are validated mean percentages, shown as one clean number. Detailed machine records retain every contributing seed. `—` means evidence is unavailable, not zero.

| protocol | iterations | mIoU | mean accuracy | mean precision | mean Dice | mean specificity | pixel accuracy | fwIoU | boundary F1 |

### Standardized model-only inference

Pending one measurement from this model's RailSem19-only 21-class EMA checkpoint on an NVIDIA L40S: PyTorch eager public forward, BF16 autocast, batch 1, 1024x1024, 20 warmup and 100 CUDA-event-timed iterations. It includes all model-internal conversion to dense logits, including query collapse where applicable, and excludes I/O, preprocessing, sliding windows, argmax, and metrics.

### Training and full-pipeline evaluation cost

Training wall time and GPU-hours sum every curriculum stage. Peak training VRAM is the maximum per-device allocator-reserved high-water mark. Full-pipeline throughput includes the loader, sliding-window inference, and metrics.

| protocol | train wall / run | GPU-hours / run | peak train VRAM / GPU | full validation images/s |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Cityscapes | 7h 54m 19s | 7.91 | 6.61 GiB | 6.192 |
